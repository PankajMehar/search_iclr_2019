IMPROVING COMPOSITION OF SENTENCE EMBEDDINGS THROUGH THE LENS OF STATISTICAL RELATIONAL LEARNING
Anonymous authors Paper under double-blind review
ABSTRACT
Various NLP problems ­ such as the prediction of sentence similarity, entailment, and discourse relations ­ are all instances of the same general task: the modeling of semantic relations between a pair of textual elements. We call them textual relational problems. A popular model for textual relational problems is to embed sentences into fixed size vectors and use composition functions (e.g. difference or concatenation) of those vectors as features for the prediction. Meanwhile, composition of embeddings has been a main focus within the field of Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) whose goal is to predict relations between entities (typically from knowledge base triples). In this work, we prove that textual relational models implicitly use compositions from baseline SRL models. We show that such compositions are not expressive enough for several tasks (e.g. natural language inference). We build on recent SRL models to solve textual relational problems, showing that they are more expressive, and can alleviate issues from simpler compositions. The resulting models significantly improve the state of the art in both transferable sentence representation learning and relation prediction.
1 INTRODUCTION
Predicting relations between textual units is a widespread task, essential for discourse analysis, dialog systems, information retrieval, or paraphrase detection. Since relation prediction often requires a form of understanding, it can also be used as a proxy to learn transferable sentence representations. Several tasks that are useful to build sentence representations are derived directly from text structure, without human annotation: sentence order prediction (Logeswaran et al., 2016; Jernite et al., 2017), the prediction of previous and subsequent sentences (Kiros et al., 2015; Jernite et al., 2017), or the prediction of explicit discourse markers between sentence pairs (Nie et al., 2017; Jernite et al., 2017). Human labeled relations between sentences can also be used for that purpose, e.g. inferential relations (Conneau et al., 2017). While most work on sentence similarity estimation, entailment detection, answer selection, or discourse relation prediction seemingly uses task-specific models, they all involve predicting whether a relation R holds between two sentences s1 and s2. This genericity has been noticed in the literature before (Baudis et al., 2016) and it has been leveraged for the evaluation of sentence embeddings within the SentEval framework (Conneau et al., 2017).
A straightforward way to predict the probability of (s1, R, s2) being true is to represent s1 and s2 with d-dimensional embeddings h1 and h2, and to compute sentence pair features f (h1, h2), where f is a composition function (e.g. concatenation, product, . . . ). A softmax classifier g can learn to predict R with those features. g  f can be seen as a reasoning over its input embeddings (Socher et al., 2013). We address here limitations of existing compositions for textual relational learning.
Our contributions are as follows:
­ we review composition functions used in textual relational learning and show that they lack expressiveness (section 2);
­ we draw analogies with existing SRL models (section 3) and design new compositions inspired from SRL (section 4);

­ we perform extensive experiments to test composition functions and show that some of them can improve the learning of representations and their downstream uses (section 6).

2 COMPOSITION FUNCTIONS FOR RELATION PREDICTION

We review here popular composition functions used for relation prediction based on sentence embeddings. Ideally, they should simultaneously fulfill the following minimal requirements:

­ make use of interactions between representations of sentences to relate; ­ allow for the learning of asymmetric relations (e.g. entailment, order); ­ be usable with high dimensionalities.

A straightforward instantiation of f is concatenation (Hooda & Kosseim, 2017):

f[,](h1, h2) = [h1, h2]

(1)

However, interactions between s1 and s2 cannot be modeled with f[,] followed by a softmax regression.1 Consider a paraphrase detection task: given a sentence s1, the sentence s2 maximizing the probability of s2 being an s1 paraphrase does not even depend on s1 with this composition. This effect has been noticed in Levy et al. (2015) regarding lexical relations. To promote interactions
between h1 and h2, element-wise product has been used in Baudis et al. (2016):

f (h1, h2) = h1 h2

(2)

Absolute difference is another solution for sentence similarity (Mueller & Thyagarajan, 2016), and its element-wise variation may equally be used to compute informative features:

f-(h1, h2) = |h1 - h2|

(3)

The latter two were combined into a popular instantiation (Tai et al., 2015; Kiros et al., 2015; Mou

et al., 2015):

f -(h1, h2) = [h1 h2, |h2 - h1|]

(4)

Although effective for certain similarity tasks, f - is symmetrical, and should be a poor choice for tasks like entailment prediction or prediction of discourse relations. For instance, if Re denotes entailment and (s1, s2)= ("It just rained", "The ground is wet"), (s1, Re, s2) should hold but not (s2, Re, s1). The f - composition function is nonetheless used to train/evaluate models on entailment (Conneau et al., 2017) or discourse relation prediction (Nie et al., 2017).

Sometimes [h1, h2] is concatenated to f -(h1, h2) (Ampomah et al., 2016; Nie et al., 2017; Conneau et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2017). While this composition is asymmetrical, asymmetric interaction between h1 and h2 stays additive and weak (Socher et al., 2013).

An outer product  has been used instead for asymmetric multiplicative interaction (Jernite et al.,

2017):

f(h1, h2) = h1  h2 where (h1  h2)i,j = h1ih2j

(5)

This formulation is expressive but it forces g to have d2 parameters per relation, which is prohibitive when there are many relations and d is high. It can also hinder sentence representation learning. The
problems outlined above are well known in SRL.

To sum up, existing compositions (except f) can only model relations superficially for tasks currently used to train state of the art sentence encoders, like NLI or discourse connectives prediction.

3 STATISTICAL RELATIONAL LEARNING MODELS
In this section we introduce the context of statistical relational learning (SRL) and relevant models. Recently, SRL has focused on efficient and expressive relation prediction based on embeddings.
1Using a multi-layer perceptron before the softmax would solve this issue, but it harms sentence representation learning (Conneau et al., 2017; Logeswaran & Lee, 2018).

Table 1 Selected relational learning models. Following Trouillon et al. (2016), < a, b, c > denotes
k akbkck. Re(x) is the real part of x, and p is commonly set to 1.

A core goal of SRL (Getoor & Taskar, 2007) is to induce whether a relation R holds between two arbitrary entities e1, e2. As an example, we would like to assign a score to (e1, R, e2) = (Paris, LOCATED IN, France) that reflects a high probability. In embedding-based SRL models, entities ei have vector representations in Rd and a scoring function reflects truth values of relations. The scoring function should allow for relation-dependent reasoning over the latent space of entities. Scoring functions can have relation-specific parameters, which can be interpreted as relation embeddings. Table 1 presents an overview of a number of state of the art relational models. We can distinguish two families of models: subtractive and multiplicative.
The TransE scoring function is motivated by the idea that translations in latent space can model analogical reasoning and hierarchical relationships. Dense word embeddings trained on tasks related to the distributional hypothesis naturally allow for analogical reasoning with translations without explicit training on this task (Mikolov et al., 2013). TransE can be seen as a generalization of the older Unstructured model. We call them subtractive models.
The RESCAL, Distmult, and ComplEx scoring functions can be seen as dot product matching between e1 and a relation-specific linear transformation of e2 (Liu et al., 2017). This transformation helps checking whether e1 matches with some aspects of e2. This is well suited for similarity learning or to check associations of characteristics between entities. RESCAL allows a full linear mapping Wre2 but has a high complexity, while Distmult is restricted to a component-wise weighting wr e2. ComplEx has fewer parameters than RESCAL but still allows for the modeling of asymmetrical relations. It can be interpreted as a variation of Distmult using a Hermitian product on complex embeddings instead of a dot product on real embeddings. As shown in Liu et al. (2017), ComplEx boils down to a restriction of RESCAL where Wr is a block diagonal matrix. These blocks are 2-dimensional, antisymmetric and have equal diagonal terms. Using such a form, even and odd indexes of e's dimensions play the roles of real and imaginary numbers respectively. The ComplEx model yields state of the art performance on knowledge base completion (Trouillon et al., 2016).
4 TEXTUAL RELATIONAL LEARNING COMPOSITION FUNCTIONS AS SRL
MODELS
We call "textual relational models" relational learning models where sentence embeddings hi act as entity embeddings ei, as shown in figure 1. In the following we focus on sentence embeddings, although the model can be straightforwardly applied to other levels of language granularity (such as words, clauses, or documents).
In this section we will make a link between sentence composition functions and SRL scoring functions, and propose new scoring functions drawing inspiration from SRL.
4.1 LINKING COMPOSITION FUNCTIONS AND SRL MODELS
The composition function f from equation 2 followed by a softmax regression yields a score whose analytical form is identical to the Distmult model score described in section 3. If R denotes the softmax weights for relation R, the logit score for the truth of (s1, R, s2) is f (h1, h2)R = (h1 h2)R which is equal to the Distmult scoring function < h1, R, h2 > if h acts as entity embedding and R as the relation weight wR .

Figure 2: Scoring function values according to different composition functions. s1 and R are fixed and color brightness reflects likelihood of (s1, R, s2) for each position of s2 embedding. (b) and (d) are respectively more expressive than (a) and (c).

Similarly, the composition f- from equation 3 followed by a softmax regression can be seen as an element-wise weighted score of Unstructured (both are equal if softmax weights are all unitary).
Thus, f - from 4 (with softmax regression) can be seen as a weighted ensemble of Unstructured and Distmult. These two models are respectively outperformed by TransE and ComplEx on knowledge base link prediction by a large margin (Trouillon et al., 2016; Bordes et al., 2013a). We therefore propose to change the Unstructured and Distmult in f - such that they match their respective state of the art variations. We will also show the implications of these refinements.

4.2 CASTING TRANSE AS A COMPOSITION

Simply replacing |h2 - h1| with

ft(h1, h2) = |h2 - h1 + t|, where t  Rd

(6)

would make the model analogous to TransE. t is learned and is shared by all relations. A relationspecific translation tR could be used but it would make f relation-specific and disallow the use of a standard softmax. Instead, here, each dimension of ft(h1, h2) can be weighted according to a given relation. Non-zero t makes ft asymmetrical and also yields features that allow for the checking of an analogy between s1 and s2. Sentence embeddings often rely on pre-trained word embeddings which have demonstrated strong capabilities for analogical reasoning. Some analogies, such as part-
whole, are computable with off-the-shelf word embeddings (Chen et al., 2017) and should be very
informative for natural language inference tasks with sentence embeddings. As an illustration, let
us consider an artificial semantic space (depicted in figures 2a and 2b) where we posit that there is a

4

Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2019

"to the past" translation t so that h1 + t is the embedding of a sentence s1 changed to the past tense. Unstructured is not able to leverage this semantic space to correctly score (s1, Rto the past, s2) while TransE is well tailored to provide highest scores for sentences near h1 + t^ where t^ is an estimation of t that could be learned from examples.

4.3 CASTING COMPLEX AS A COMPOSITION

Let us partition h dimensions into two equally sized groups R and I. For instance, they could be
even and odd dimension indices of h. We propose a new function fC as a way to fit the ComplEx scoring function into a composition function.

fC(h1, h2) = [h1R h2R + hI1 hI2 , hR1 h2I - hI1 h2R]

(7)

fC(h1, h2) multiplied by softmax weights r is equivalent to the ComplEx scoring function
Re < h1, r, h2 >. The first half of r weights corresponds to the real part of ComplEx relation weights while the last half corresponds to the imaginary part.

fC is to the ComplEx scoring function what f is to the DistMult scoring function. Intuitively, ComplEx is a minimal way to model interactions between distinct latent dimensions while Distmult
only allows for identical dimensions to interact.

Let us consider a new artificial semantic space (shown in figures 2c and 2d) with the first dimension activating when a sentence means that it just rained, and the second dimension activating when the ground is wet. Over this semantic space, Distmult is only able to recognize entailment for paraphrases whereas ComplEx is also able to naturally model that ("it just rained", Rentailment, "the ground is wet") should be high while its converse should not.

We also propose two more general versions of fC :
fC (h1, h2) = [hR1 hR2 , h1I h2I , hR1 h2I - hI1 hR2 ] fC (h1, h2) = [hR1 hR2 , h1I hI2 , hR1 hI2 , hI1 h2R]

(8) (9)

fC can be seen as Distmult concatenated with the asymmetrical part of ComplEx and fC can be seen as RESCAL with unconstrained block diagonal relation matrices. These compositions have higher dimensionality but this is not as problematic as in SRL (Freebase contains 35k relation types
which can make it hard to learn high dimensional relation embeddings). NLP problems tend to have
a moderate number of relations and we can afford to use slightly more relation parameters.

5 ON THE EVALUATION OF RELATIONAL MODELS
The SentEval framework (Conneau et al., 2017) provides a general evaluation with open source evaluation code. One only needs to specify a sentence encoder function, and the framework performs classification tasks or relation prediction tasks using cross-validated logistic regression on embeddings or composed sentence embeddings. Tasks include sentiment analysis, entailment, textual similarity, textual relatedness, and paraphrase detection. These tasks are a rich way to train or evaluate sentence representations since in a triple (s1, R, s2), we can see (R, s2) as a label for s1 (Baudis et al., 2016). Unfortunately, the relational tasks hard-code the composition function from equation 4. From our previous analysis, we believe this composition function favors the use of contextual/lexical similarity rather than high-level reasoning and can penalize representations based on more semantic aspects. This bias could harm research since semantic representation is an important next step for sentence embedding. Training/evaluation datasets are also arguably flawed with respect to relational aspects since several recent studies (Dasgupta et al., 2018; Poliak et al., 2018; Levy et al., 2018; Glockner et al., 2018) show that InferSent, despite being state of the art on SentEval evaluation tasks, has poor performance when dealing with asymmetrical tasks and non-additive composition of words. In addition to providing new ways of training sentence encoders, we will also extend the SentEval evaluation framework with a more expressive composition function when dealing with relational transfer tasks, which improves results even when the sentence encoder was not trained with it.

6 EXPERIMENTS
Our goal is to show that transferable sentence representation learning and relation prediction tasks can be improved when our expressive compositions are used instead of the composition from equation 4. We train our relational model adaptations on two relation prediction base tasks (T ), one supervised (T = NLI ) and one unsupervised (T = Disc) described below, and evaluate sentence/relation representations on base and transfer tasks using the SentEval framework in order to quantify the generalization capabilities of our models. The code for our experiments will be publicly available.
6.1 TRAINING TASKS
Natural language inference (T =NLI)'s goal is to predict whether the relation between two sentences (premise and hypothesis) is Entailment, Contradiction or Neutral. We use the SNLI dataset (Bowman et al., 2015) which contains 570k examples based on Flickr captions and manual annotations. We also use the MNLI dataset (Williams et al., 2017) which amounts to 433k examples across various domains. We call the resulting dataset AllNLI. Conneau et al. (2017) claim that NLI data allows universal sentence representation learning. They used the f ,- composition function with concatenated sentence representations in order to train their Infersent model.
We also train on the prediction of discourse connectives between sentences/clauses (T = Disc). Discourse connectives make discourse relations between sentences explicit. In the sentence I live in Paris but I'm often elsewhere, the word but highlights that there is a contrast between the two clauses it connects. We use Malmi et al.'s (2017) dataset of selected 400k instances with 20 discourse connectives (e.g. however, for example) with the provided train/dev/test split. This dataset has no other supervision than the list of 20 connectives. Nie et al. (2017) used f ,- concatenated with the sum of sentence representations to train their model, DisSent, on a similar task and showed that their encoder was general enough to perform well on SentEval tasks. They use a not yet available dataset.
6.2 EVALUATION TASKS
Table 2 provides an overview of different transfer tasks that will be used for evaluation. We added another relation prediction task, the PDTB coarse-grained implicit discourse relation task, to SentEval. This task involves predicting a discursive link between two sentences among {Comparison, Contingency, Entity based coherence, Expansion, Temporal}. We followed the setup of Pitler et al. (2009), without sampling negative examples in training. MRPC, PDTB and SICK will be tested with two composition functions: besides SentEval composition f ,-, we will use fC,- for transfer learning evaluation, since it has the most general multiplicative interaction and it does not penalize models that do not learn a translation. For all tasks except STS14, a cross-validated logistic regression is used on the sentence or relation representation. The evaluation of the STS14 task relies on Pearson or Spearman correlation between cosine similarity and the target. We force the composition function to be symmetrical on the MRPC task since paraphrase detection should be invariant to permutation of input sentences.

and SICK ­ besides the original composition function ­ we equally evaluate using an alternative composition function, e.g. MRPC- is the standard MRPC task used in SentEval and MRPC- uses fC,- composition to evaluate trained models. All scores are accuracy percentages, except STS14, which is Pearson correlation percentage. SkipT is SkipThought from Kiros et al. (2015) and BoW
is our re-evaluation of GloVe Bag of Words from Conneau et al. (2017). InferSent is from Conneau
et al. (2017) and has state of the art results in transferable sentence representation learning.
.

6.3 SETUP

We want to compare the different instances of f . We follow the setup of Infersent (Conneau et al.,
2017): we learn to encode sentences into h with a bi-directional LSTM using element-wise max
pooling over time. The dimension size of h is 4096. Word embeddings are fixed GloVe with 300 dimensions, trained on Common Crawl 840B2. Optimization is done with SGD and decreasing
learning rate until convergence.

The only difference with regard to Infersent is the composition. Sentences are composed with six different compositions for training according to the following template:

fm,s,1,2(h1, h2) = [fm(h1, h2), fs(h1, h2), h1, h2]

(10)

fs (subtractive interaction) is in {f-, ft}, fm (multiplicative interaction) is in {f , fC , fC }. We do not consider fC since it yielded inferior results in our early experiments using NLI and SentEval
development sets.

fm,s,1,2(h1, h2) is fed directly to a softmax regression. Note that Infersent uses a multi-layer percep-
tron before the softmax, but uses only linear activations, so f ,-,1,2(h1, h2) is analytically equivalent to Infersent when T = NLI .

6.4 RESULTS
Having run several experiments with different initializations, the standard deviations between them do not seem to be negligible. We decided to take these into account when reporting scores, contrary to previous work (Kiros et al., 2015; Conneau et al., 2017): we average the scores of 6 models for
2https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

7

Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2019

each task and use standard deviations to compute significance. Table 3 shows model scores for both T = NLI and T = Disc, as well as two other important models from previous work.
For sentence representation learning, the baseline, f - composition already performs rather well,
being on par with InferSent as it should. However, macro-averaging all accuracies, it is the second worst whether or not C is used for transfer evaluation. fC,t,1,2 is the best performing model, and all three best models use the translation (s = t). Training with fC,t,1,2 and using complex C for transfer always outperform the baseline (f ,-,1,2 with - composition) on relational transfer tasks: averaging accuracies of those transfer tasks, this result is significant for both training tasks at level p < 0.05 (using Bonferroni correction accounting for the 5 comparisons). To our knowledge,
it outperforms all previously reported scores (Conneau et al., 2017) on SICK Entailment task with
single task training. On base tasks and the average of non-relational transfer tasks (MR, MPQA, SUBJ, TREC), our proposed compositions are on average slightly better than f ,-,1,2. Representations learned with our proposed compositions can still be compared with simple angular similarity: all 3 methods using the translational composition (s = t) very significantly outperform the baseline (significant at level p < 0.01 with Bonferroni correction) on STS14 for T = NLI . Thus, we believe fC,t,1,2 has more robust results and could be a better default choice than f ,-,1,2 as composition for representation learning. Besides, using C instead of for transfer learning (e.g. PDTB- instead of PDTB-) in relational transfer tasks (PDTB, MRPC, SICK) yields a significant improvement on average, even when m = was used for training (p < 0.001). Therefore, we believe fC,- is an interesting composition for inference or evaluation of models regardless of how they were trained.
Another advantage of our compositions is a faster convergence speed: on average, each of our proposed compositions needed less epochs to converge than the baseline f ,-,1,2, for both training tasks.

7 RELATED WORK

There are numerous interactions between SRL and NLP. We believe that our approach merges two specific lines of work: word relation prediction and modeling textual relational tasks.

Some previous NLP work focused on composition functions for relation prediction between words,

even though they ignored SRL. task with word analogies in the

lWatoenrdt 2svpeacce(Msuickholaosv-ke-itnagl-., 2q-0u-1e-3e)nhas

sparked a great interest for this -m-an - w--o-m--an. Levy & Gold-

berg (2014) explored different scoring functions between words, notably for analogies. Hypernymy

relations were also studied, by Chang et al. (2017) and Fu et al. (2014). Levy et al. (2015) proposed

tailored scoring functions. Even the skipgram model (Mikolov et al., 2013) can be formulated as

finding relations between context and target words. We did not empirically explore textual relational

learning at the word level, but we believe that it would fit in our framework, and could be improved

by the techniques introduced in this paper.

Some modeling aspects of textual relational learning have been formally investigated by Baudis et al. (2016). They noticed the genericity of relational problems and explored multi-task and transfer learning on relational tasks. Their work is complementary to ours since their framework unifies tasks while ours unifies composition functions. Subsequent approaches use relational tasks for training and evaluation on specific datasets (Conneau et al., 2017; Nie et al., 2017).

8 CONCLUSION
We have demonstrated that a number of existing models used for textual relational learning rely on composition functions that are already used in Statistical Relational Learning. By taking into account previous insights from SRL, we proposed new composition functions and demonstrated their usefulness for tasks presented in recent work. These composition functions are all simple to implement and we hope that it will become standard to try them on relational problems. Larger scale data might leverage these more expressive compositions, as well as more compositional, asymmetric, and arguably more realistic datasets (Dasgupta et al., 2018; Gururangan et al., 2018). Finally, expressive compositions can also be helpful to improve interpretability and evaluation of sentence embeddings by providing sentence level analogies.
