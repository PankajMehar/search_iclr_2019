Recent work has extended these ideas beyond deterministic hierarchies to probabilistically calibrated models, which enable learning from uncertain supervision and inferring soft-inclusions among concepts, while maintaining the geometric inductive bias of hierarchical embedding models. We build on the Box Lattice model of Vilnis et al. (2018), which showed promising results in modeling soft-inclusions through an overlapping hierarchy of sets, parameterized as high-dimensional hyperrectangles (boxes). However, the hard edges of the boxes present difficulties for standard gradient based optimization; that work employed a special surrogate function for the disjoint case, but we find this method to be fragile.  In this work, we present a novel hierarchical embedding model, inspired by a relaxation of box embeddings into parameterized density functions using Gaussian convolutions over the boxes. Our approach provides an alternative surrogate to the original lattice measure that improves the robustness of optimization in the disjoint case, while also preserving the desirable properties with respect to the original lattice. We demonstrate increased or matching performance on WordNet hypernymy prediction, Flickr caption entailment, and a MovieLens-based market basket dataset. We show especially marked improvements in the case of sparse data, where many conditional probabilities should be low, and thus boxes should be nearly disjoint.","keywords":["embeddings","order embeddings","knowledge graph embedding","relational learning"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"Improve hierarchical embedding models using kernel smoothing","pdf":"/pdf/611e90d4097cd1d4f64925915d3fb0c61b1b8b36.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|smoothing_the_geometry_of_probabilistic_box_embeddings","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019smoothing,    \ntitle={Smoothing the Geometry of Probabilistic Box Embeddings},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=H1xSNiRcF7},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"S1gUVjCqKm","original":"HyenhvCqKX","number":2,"cdate":1538087725593,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087725593,"tmdate":1538156262792,"tddate":null,"forum":"S1gUVjCqKm","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Unsupervised classification into unknown k classes","abstract":"We propose a novel spectral decomposition framework for the unsupervised classification\ntask.

Unlike greedy search, beam search allows for a non-greedy local decisions that can potentially lead to a sequence with a higher overall probability. However, previous work found that the performance of beam search tends to degrade with large beam widths. In this work, we perform an empirical study of the behavior of the beam search algorithm across three sequence synthesis tasks. We find that increasing the beam width leads to sequences that are disproportionately based on early and highly non-greedy decisions. These sequences typically include a very low probability token that is followed by a sequence of tokens with higher (conditional) probability leading to an overall higher probability sequence. However, as beam width increases, such sequences are more likely to have a lower evaluation score. Based on our empirical analysis we propose to constrain the beam search from taking highly non-greedy decisions early in the search. We evaluate two methods to constrain the search and show that constrained beam search effectively eliminates the problem of beam search degradation and in some cases even leads to higher evaluation scores. Our results generalize and improve upon previous observations on copies and training set predictions.","paperhash":"anonymous|unconstrained_beam_search_is_sensitive_to_large_search_discrepancies","keywords":["beam search","sequence models","search","sequence to sequence"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper6/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"Analysis of the performance degradation in beam search and how constraining the the search can help avoiding it","pdf":"/pdf/6459eea181e08bb8b5936ada5c0ac4156c2e4ff0.pdf","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019(unconstrained),    \ntitle={(Unconstrained) Beam Search is Sensitive to Large Search Discrepancies},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=BkE8NjCqYm},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"SkgD4jAcYX","original":"HJgQhhI_t7","number":7,"cdate":1538087726570,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087726570,"tmdate":1538156261758,"tddate":null,"forum":"SkgD4jAcYX","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Adaptive Convolutional ReLUs","abstract":"Rectified linear units (ReLUs) are currently the most popular activation function used in neural networks. Although ReLUs can solve the gradient vanishing problem and accelerate training convergence, it suffers from the dying ReLU problem in which some neurons are never activated if the weights are not updated properly. In this work, we propose a novel activation function, known as the adaptive convolutional ReLU (ConvReLU), that can better mimic brain neuron activation behaviors and overcome the dying ReLU problem. With our novel parameter sharing scheme, ConvReLUs can be applied to convolution layers that allow each input neuron to be activated by different trainable thresholds without involving a large number of extra parameters. We employ the zero initialization scheme in ConvReLU to encourage trainable thresholds to be close to zero. Finally, we develop a partial replacement strategy that only replaces the ReLUs in the early layers of the network. This resolves the dying ReLU problem and retains sparse representations for linear classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed ConvReLU has consistently better performance compared to ReLU, LeakyReLU, and PReLU.

But these approaches struggle on sparse-reward domains like Montezuma’s Revenge where the probability that any random action sequence leads to reward is extremely low. Recent algorithms have performed well on such tasks by encouraging agents to visit new states or perform new actions in relation to all prior training episodes (which we call across-training novelty). But such algorithms do not consider whether an agent exhibits intra-life novelty: doing something new within the current episode, regardless of whether those behaviors have been performed in previous episodes. We hypothesize that across-training novelty might discourage agents from revisiting initially non-rewarding states that could become important stepping stones later in training—a problem remedied by encouraging intra-life novelty. We introduce Curiosity Search for deep reinforcement learning, or Deep Curiosity Search (DeepCS), which encourages intra-life exploration by rewarding agents for visiting as many different states as possible within each episode, and show that DeepCS matches the performance of current state-of-the-art methods on Montezuma’s Revenge. We further show that DeepCS improves exploration on Amidar, Freeway, Gravitar, and Tutankham (many of which are hard exploration games). Surprisingly, DeepCS also doubles A2C performance on Seaquest, a game we would not have expected to benefit from intra-life exploration because the arena is small and already easily navigated by naive exploration techniques. In one run, DeepCS achieves a maximum training score of 80,000 points on Seaquest—higher than any methods other than Ape-X. The strong performance of DeepCS on these sparse- and dense-reward tasks suggests that encouraging intra-life novelty is an interesting, new approach for improving performance in Deep RL and motivates further research into hybridizing across-training and intra-life exploration methods.","paperhash":"anonymous|deep_curiosity_search_intralife_exploration_can_improve_performance_on_challenging_deep_reinforcement_learning_problems","authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper8/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"keywords":[],"pdf":"/pdf/ea7ffa446d2756ab38c592d7481e25cd97ba1f9d.pdf","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019deep,    \ntitle={Deep Curiosity Search: Intra-Life Exploration Can Improve Performance on Challenging Deep Reinforcement Learning Problems},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=BkeDEoCctQ},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"ryGDEjCcK7","original":"r1g55QzFYQ","number":9,"cdate":1538087726963,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087726963,"tmdate":1538156261326,"tddate":null,"forum":"ryGDEjCcK7","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"CONTROLLING COVARIATE SHIFT USING EQUILIBRIUM NORMALIZATION OF WEIGHTS","abstract":"We introduce a new normalization technique that exhibits the fast convergence properties of batch normalization using a transformation of layer weights instead of layer outputs.

To reveal the global structure of a trained neural network in an interpretable way, a series of clustering methods have been proposed, which decompose the units into clusters according to the similarity of their inference roles. The main problems in these studies were that (1) we have no prior knowledge about the optimal resolution for the decomposition, or the appropriate number of clusters, and (2) there was no method with which to acquire knowledge about whether the outputs of each cluster have a positive or negative correlation with the input and output dimension values. \nIn this paper, to solve these problems, we propose a method for obtaining a hierarchical modular representation of a layered neural network. The application of a hierarchical clustering method to a trained network reveals a tree-structured relationship among hidden layer units, based on their feature vectors defined by their correlation with the input and output dimension values.

As a consequence, it has become a key component of sequence-to-sequence models that yield state-of-the-art performance in as hard tasks as abstractive document summarization (ADS), machine translation (MT), and video captioning (VC). NA mechanisms perform inference of context vectors; these constitute weighted sums of deterministic input sequence encodings, adaptively sourced over long temporal horizons. However, recent work in the field of amortized variational inference (AVI) has shown that it is often useful to treat the representations generated by deep networks as latent random variables. This allows for the models to learn to infer representations that offer much stronger generalization capacity.  Based on this motivation, in this work we introduce a novel regard towards a popular NA mechanism, namely soft-attention (SA). Our approach treats the context vectors generated by SA models as latent variables, the finite mixture model posteriors of which are inferred by employing AVI. Both the component means and the covariance matrices of the inferred posteriors are parameterized via deep network mechanisms similar to those employed in the context of standard SA. To illustrate our method, we implement it in the context of popular sequence-to-sequence model variants with SA. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation using challenging ADS, VC, and MT benchmarks, and show how our approach compares to the baselines. \n","paperhash":"anonymous|amortized_context_vector_inference_for_sequencetosequence_networks","keywords":["neural attention","sequence-to-sequence","variational inference"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper16/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"A generalisation of context representation in neural attention under the variational inference rationale.","pdf":"/pdf/3150fa253394221ab9cc144bb5fab19f8277d893.pdf","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019amortized,    \ntitle={Amortized Context Vector Inference for Sequence-to-Sequence Networks},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=SygONjRqKm},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"SyxYEoA5FX","original":"Hklyjj-K_7","number":17,"cdate":1538087728518,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087728518,"tmdate":1538156259677,"tddate":null,"forum":"SyxYEoA5FX","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Invariance and Inverse Stability under ReLU","abstract":"We flip the usual approach to study invariance and robustness of neural networks by considering the non-uniqueness and instability of the inverse mapping.

However, most data signals do not natively exist on a grid, and in the process of being sampled onto a uniform physical grid suffer significant aliasing error and information loss. Moreover, signals can exist in different topological structures as, for example, points, lines, surfaces and volumes. It has been challenging to analyze signals with mixed topologies (for example, point cloud with surface mesh). To this end, we develop mathematical formulations for Non-Uniform Fourier Transforms (NUFT) to directly, and optimally, sample nonuniform data signals of different topologies defined on a simplex mesh into the spectral domain with no spatial sampling error. The spectral transform is performed in the Euclidean space, which removes the translation ambiguity from works on the graph spectrum. Our representation has four distinct advantages: (1) the process causes no spatial sampling error during initial sampling, (2) the generality of this approach provides a unified framework for using CNNs to analyze signals of mixed topologies, (3) it allows us to leverage state-of-the-art backbone CNN architectures for effective learning without having to design a particular architecture for a particular data structure in an ad-hoc fashion, and (4) the representation allows weighted meshes where each element has a different weight (i.e., texture) indicating local properties.

Recent promising developments generally depend on problem-specific density models or handcrafted features. In this paper we introduce a simple approach for exploration that allows us to develop theoretically justified algorithms in the tabular case but that also give us intuitions for new algorithms applicable to settings where function approximation is required. Our approach and its underlying theory is based on the substochastic successor representation, a concept we develop here. While the traditional successor representation is a representation that defines state generalization by the similarity of successor states, the substochastic successor representation is also able to implicitly count the number of times each state (or feature) has been observed. This extension connects two until now disjoint areas of research. We show in traditional tabular domains (RiverSwim and SixArms) that our algorithm empirically performs as well as other sample-efficient algorithms.

In this paper, we make the first theoretical justification for the concept of STE, by considering the problem of learning a one-hidden-layer convolutional network with binarized ReLU activation and Gaussian input data. We refer to the unusual “gradient” based on STE as coarse gradient, which essentially is not the gradient of any function. Apparently, the choice of STE is not unique. We prove that if the STE is properly chosen, the negative expected coarse gradient is a descent direction for minimizing the population loss, and the associated coarse gradient descent algorithm converges to a local minimum (more rigorously, a critical point) of the population loss minimization problem. Moreover, we show that a relatively poor choice of STE may lead to instability of the training algorithm near certain local minima, which is also validated by our CIFAR-10 experiments.\n","paperhash":"anonymous|understanding_straightthrough_estimator_in_training_activation_quantized_neural_nets","keywords":["straight-through estimator","quantized activation","binary neuron"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper33/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"We make the first theoretical justification for the concept of straight-through estimator.","pdf":"/pdf/e3aa4208c3bf03ac5980860e3489456c8b299dc8.pdf","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019understanding,    \ntitle={Understanding Straight-Through Estimator in Training Activation Quantized Neural Nets},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=Skh4jRcKQ},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"BJlhEs09YQ","original":"Syl_e6N_tQ","number":34,"cdate":1538087731714,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087731714,"tmdate":1538156256145,"tddate":null,"forum":"BJlhEs09YQ","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"End-to-end Learning of a Convolutional Neural Network via Deep Tensor Decomposition","abstract":"In this paper we study the problem of learning the weights of a deep convolutional neural network.

Finally, we empirically show the robustness and versatility of our approach in two defence scenarios where universal attacks are performed on several image classification datasets -- CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet.","paperhash":"anonymous|playing_the_game_of_universal_adversarial_perturbations","keywords":["adversarial perturbations","universal adversarial perturbations","game theory","robust machine learning"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper37/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"We propose a robustification method under the presence of universal adversarial perturbations, by connecting a game theoretic method (fictitious play) with the problem of robustification, and making it more scalable.","pdf":"/pdf/6cd41234a734d984abec18c6ef243a2e4073f4b2.pdf","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019playing,    \ntitle={Playing the Game of Universal Adversarial Perturbations},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=ryeh4jA9F7},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"HyGh4sR9YQ","original":"r1l-0SMdKX","number":38,"cdate":1538087732458,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087732458,"tmdate":1538156255233,"tddate":null,"forum":"HyGh4sR9YQ","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Deep Neuroevolution: Genetic Algorithms are a Competitive Alternative for Training Deep Neural Networks for Reinforcement Learning","abstract":"Deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained via gradient-based learning algorithms, namely backpropagation. \nEvolution strategies (ES) can rival backprop-based algorithms such as Q-learning and policy gradients on challenging deep reinforcement learning (RL) problems. However, ES can be considered a gradient-based algorithm because it performs stochastic gradient descent via an operation similar to a finite-difference approximation of the gradient.\nThat raises the question of whether non-gradient-based evolutionary algorithms can work at DNN scales. \nHere we demonstrate they can: we evolve the weights of a DNN with a simple, gradient-free, population-based genetic algorithm (GA) and it performs well on hard deep RL problems, including Atari and humanoid locomotion. The Deep GA successfully evolves networks with over four million free parameters, the largest neural networks ever evolved with a traditional evolutionary algorithm. These results (1) expand our sense of the scale at which GAs can operate, (2) suggest intriguingly that in some cases following the gradient is not the best choice for optimizing performance, and (3) make immediately available the multitude of neuroevolution techniques that improve performance.

Human beings can learn and classify prototypes as well as transformations of objects. While neural networks store learned knowledge in a more hybrid way of combining all prototypes and transformations as a whole distribution. Hybrid storage may lead to lower distances between different classes so that small modifications can mislead the classifier. A one-step distribution imitation method is designed to imitate distribution of the nearest different class neighbor. Experiments show that simply by imitating distributions from a training set without any knowledge of the classifier can still lead to obvious impacts on classification results from deep networks. It also implies that adversarial examples can be in more forms than small perturbations. Potential ways of alleviating adversarial examples are discussed from the representation point of view. The first path is to change the encoding of data sent to the training step. Training data that are more prototypical can help seize more robust and accurate structural knowledge.

To this end, low-precision networks offer tremendous promise because both energy and area scale down quadratically with the reduction in precision.  Here, for the first time, we demonstrate ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, ResNet-152, Inception-v3, densenet-161, and VGG-16bn networks on the ImageNet classification benchmark that, at 8-bit precision exceed the accuracy of the full-precision baseline networks after one epoch of finetuning, thereby leveraging the availability of pretrained models.\nWe also demonstrate for the first time ResNet-18, ResNet-34, and ResNet-50 4-bit models that match the accuracy of the full-precision baseline networks. Surprisingly, the weights of the low-precision networks are very close (in cosine similarity) to the weights of the corresponding baseline networks, making training from scratch unnecessary.\n\nWe find that gradient noise due to quantization during training increases with reduced precision, and seek ways to overcome this noise. The number of iterations required by stochastic gradient descent to achieve a given training error is related to the square of (a) the distance of the initial solution from the final plus (b) the maximum variance of the gradient estimates.  By drawing inspiration from this observation, we (a) reduce solution distance by starting with pretrained fp32 precision baseline networks and fine-tuning, and (b) combat noise introduced by quantizing weights and activations during training, by using larger batches along with matched learning rate annealing.  Sensitivity analysis indicates that these techniques, coupled with proper activation function range calibration, offer a promising heuristic to discover low-precision networks, if they exist, close to fp32 precision baseline networks.\n","paperhash":"anonymous|discovering_lowprecision_networks_close_to_fullprecision_networks_for_efficient_embedded_inference","keywords":["Deep Learning","Convolutional Neural Networks","Low-precision inference","Network quantization"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper50/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"Finetuning after quantization matches or exceeds full-precision state-of-the-art networks at both 8- and 4-bit quantization.","pdf":"/pdf/4b2a2d0aa3afc563e1b0e987db5d1a66d32f04c2.pdf","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019discovering,    \ntitle={Discovering Low-Precision Networks Close to Full-Precision Networks for Efficient Embedded Inference},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=BJx1SsAcYQ},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"ryGkSo0qYm","original":"rJl6V6TUKQ","number":51,"cdate":1538087734907,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087734907,"tmdate":1538156252557,"tddate":null,"forum":"ryGkSo0qYm","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Large Scale Graph Learning From Smooth Signals","abstract":"Graphs are a prevalent tool in data science, as they model the inherent structure of the data.

However, such a task is not trivial since it often requires the full training and validation datasets for profiling the network statistics and fine tuning the networks to recover the accuracy lost after quantization. To address these issues, we propose a simple method recognizing channel-level distribution to reduce the quantization-induced accuracy loss and minimize the required image samples for profiling. We evaluated our method on eleven networks trained on the ImageNet classification benchmark and a network trained on the Pascal VOC object detection benchmark. The results prove that the networks can be quantized into 8-bit integer precision without fine tuning.","paperhash":"anonymous|quantization_for_rapid_deployment_of_deep_neural_networks","authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper62/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"keywords":[],"pdf":"/pdf/ba9149a03c9b67809a491e5f7cb02c38ae864f39.pdf","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019quantization,    \ntitle={Quantization for Rapid Deployment of Deep Neural Networks},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=HkzZBi0cFQ},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"HJgZrsC5t7","original":"Hyl7aX8zFX","number":63,"cdate":1538087737109,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087737109,"tmdate":1538156250060,"tddate":null,"forum":"HJgZrsC5t7","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Improving On-policy Learning with Statistical Reward Accumulation","abstract":"Deep reinforcement learning has obtained significant breakthroughs in recent years. Most methods in deep-RL achieve good results via the maximization of the reward signal provided by the environment, typically in the form of discounted cumulative returns. Such reward signals represent the immediate feedback of a particular action performed by an agent. However, tasks with sparse reward signals are still challenging to on-policy methods. In this paper, we introduce an effective characterization of past reward statistics (which can be seen as long-term feedback signals) to supplement this immediate reward feedback. In particular, value functions are learned with multi-critics supervision, enabling complex value functions to be more easily approximated in on-policy learning, even when the reward signals are sparse. We also introduce a novel exploration mechanism called ``hot-wiring'' that can give a boost to seemingly trapped agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our advantage actor multi-critic (A2MC) method across the discrete domains in Atari games as well as continuous domains in the MuJoCo environments.

In order to provide a better fit to the target data distribution when the dataset includes many different classes, we propose a variant of the basic GAN model, a Multi-Modal Gaussian-Mixture GAN (GM-GAN), where the probability distribution over the latent space is a mixture of Gaussians. We also propose a supervised variant which is capable of conditional sample synthesis. In order to evaluate the model's performance, we propose a new scoring method which separately takes into account two (typically conflicting) measures - diversity vs. quality of the generated data.  Through a series of experiments, using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we quantitatively show that GM-GANs outperform baselines, both when evaluated using the commonly used Inception Score, and when evaluated using our own alternative scoring method. In addition, we qualitatively demonstrate how the unsupervised variant of GM-GAN tends to map latent vectors sampled from different Gaussians in the latent space to samples of different classes in the data space. We show how this phenomenon can be exploited for the task of unsupervised clustering, and provide quantitative evaluation showing the superiority of our method for the unsupervised clustering of image datasets. Finally, we demonstrate a feature which further sets our model apart from other GAN models: the option to control the quality-diversity trade-off by altering, post-training, the probability distribution of the latent space. This allows one to sample higher quality and lower diversity samples, or vice versa, according to one's needs.","paperhash":"anonymous|multimodal_generative_adversarial_networks_for_diverse_datasets","TL;DR":"Multi modal Guassian distribution of latent space in GAN models improves performance and allows to trade-off quality vs. diversity","authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper64/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"keywords":["generative adversarial networks","generative models","clustering","visual object recognition"],"pdf":"/pdf/9581241e7ba8411f54fe22635236fd8108ea2a10.pdf","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019multi-modal,    \ntitle={Multi-Modal Generative Adversarial Networks for Diverse Datasets},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=rkgWBi09Ym},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"rJl-HsR9KX","original":"B1lgU5MMYX","number":65,"cdate":1538087737484,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087737484,"tmdate":1538156249648,"tddate":null,"forum":"rJl-HsR9KX","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Discriminative Active Learning","abstract":"We propose a new batch mode active learning algorithm designed for neural networks and large query batch sizes.

This probability encourages exploration of different batch size and then later exploitation of batch size with history of success. At each epoch, the RMGD samples a batch size from its probability distribution, then uses the selected batch size for mini-batch gradient descent. After obtaining the validation loss at each epoch, the probability distribution is updated to incorporate the effectiveness of the sampled batch size. The RMGD essentially assists the learning process to explore the possible domain of the batch size and exploit successful batch size. Experimental results show that the RMGD achieves performance better than the best performing single batch size. Furthermore, it, obviously, attains this performance in a shorter amount of time than grid search. It is surprising that the RMGD achieves better performance than grid search.","paperhash":"anonymous|a_resizable_minibatch_gradient_descent_based_on_a_multiarmed_bandit","TL;DR":"An optimization algorithm that explores various batch sizes based on probability and automatically exploits successful batch size which minimizes validation loss.","authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper68/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"keywords":["Batch size","Optimization","Mini-batch gradient descent","Multi-armed bandit"],"pdf":"/pdf/2dec0de7fef4cc60a48110b3e2b5d0ca07224c04.pdf","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019a,    \ntitle={A Resizable Mini-batch Gradient Descent based on a Multi-Armed Bandit},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=H1lGHsA9KX},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"rkeMHjR9Ym","original":"rJxfoV9WKQ","number":69,"cdate":1538087738211,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087738211,"tmdate":1538156248827,"tddate":null,"forum":"rkeMHjR9Ym","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Stochastic Gradient Descent Learns State Equations with Nonlinear Activations","abstract":"We study discrete time dynamical systems governed by the state equation $h_{t+1}=ϕ(Ah_t+Bu_t)$.

To do so, IB identifies an intermediate \"bottleneck variable\" T that has low mutual information I(X;T) and high mutual information  I(Y;T). The \"IB curve\" characterizes the set of bottleneck variables that achieve maximal I(Y;T) for a given I(X;T), and is typically explored by optimizing the \"IB Lagrangian\", I(Y;T) - βI(X;T). Recently, there has been interest in applying IB to supervised learning, particularly for classification problems that use neural networks. In most classification problems, the output class Y is a deterministic function of the input X, which we refer to as \"deterministic supervised learning\". We demonstrate three pathologies that arise when IB is used in any scenario where Y is a deterministic function of X: (1) the IB curve cannot be recovered by optimizing the IB Lagrangian for different values of β; (2) there are \"uninteresting\" solutions at all points of the IB curve; and (3) for classifiers that achieve low error rates, the activity of different hidden layers will not exhibit a strict trade-off between compression and prediction, contrary to a recent proposal. To address problem (1), we propose a functional that, unlike the IB Lagrangian, can recover the IB curve in all cases. We finish by demonstrating these issues on the MNIST dataset.","paperhash":"anonymous|pathologies_in_information_bottleneck_for_deterministic_supervised_learning","TL;DR":"Information bottleneck has pathologies in supervised learning scenarios where the output is a deterministic function of the input.","authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper77/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"keywords":["information bottleneck","supervised learning","deep learning","information theory"],"pdf":"/pdf/b60a5fa4e638a84ffb2b0feac14f620d09b6960d.pdf","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019pathologies,    \ntitle={Pathologies in information bottleneck for deterministic supervised learning},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=rke4HiAcY7},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"H1gNHs05FX","original":"ryljFK6COX","number":78,"cdate":1538087739831,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087739831,"tmdate":1538156246979,"tddate":null,"forum":"H1gNHs05FX","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Clinical Risk: wavelet reconstruction networks for marked point processes","abstract":"Timestamped sequences of events, pervasive in domains with data logs, e.g., health records, are often modeled as point processes with rate functions over time.

In this paper, we introduce two generic Variational Inference frameworks for generative models of Knowledge Graphs; Latent Fact Model and Latent Information Model.  While traditional variational methods derive an analytical approximation for the intractable distribution over the latent variables, here we construct an inference network conditioned on the symbolic representation of entities and relation types in the Knowledge Graph, to provide the variational distributions. The new framework can create models able to discover underlying probabilistic semantics for the symbolic representation by utilising parameterisable distributions which permit training by back-propagation in the context of neural variational inference, resulting in a highly-scalable method. Under a Bernoulli sampling framework, we provide an alternative justification for commonly used techniques in large-scale stochastic variational inference, which drastically reduces training time at a cost of an additional approximation to the variational lower bound.  The generative frameworks are flexible enough to allow training under any prior distribution that permits a re-parametrisation trick, as well as under any scoring function that permits maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters. Experiment results display the potential and efficiency of this framework by improving upon multiple benchmarks with Gaussian prior representations.

Re-forwarding trades training time for memory and does not compromise any performance in testing. We propose theories and algorithms that achieve the optimal memory solutions for DNNs with either linear or arbitrary computation graphs.

INVASE consists of 3 neural networks, a selector network, a predictor network and a baseline network which are used to train the selector network using the actor-critic methodology. Using this methodology, INVASE is capable of flexibly discovering feature subsets of a different size for each instance, which is a key limitation of existing state-of-the-art methods.

Furthermore, in the era of big data, designing divergence measure that is interpretable and can handle high-dimensional and complex data becomes extremely important. In this paper, we propose a post selection inference (PSI) framework for divergence measure, which can select a set of statistically significant features that discriminate two distributions. Specifically, we employ an additive variant of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) for features and introduce a general hypothesis test for PSI. A novel MMD estimator using the incomplete U-statistics, which has an asymptotically normal distribution (under mild assumptions) and gives high detection power in PSI, is also proposed and analyzed theoretically.

To ameliorate this problem, we introduce the use of hierarchical interpretations to explain DNN predictions through our proposed method: agglomerative contextual decomposition (ACD). Given a prediction from a trained DNN, ACD produces a hierarchical clustering of the input features, along with the contribution of each cluster to the final prediction. This hierarchy is optimized to identify clusters of features that the DNN learned are predictive. We introduce ACD using examples from Stanford Sentiment Treebank and ImageNet, in order to diagnose incorrect predictions, identify dataset bias, and extract polarizing phrases of varying lengths. Through human experiments, we demonstrate that ACD enables users both to identify the more accurate of two DNNs and to better trust a DNN's outputs. We also find that ACD's hierarchy is largely robust to adversarial perturbations, implying that it captures fundamental aspects of the input and ignores spurious noise.","keywords":["interpretability","natural language processing","computer vision"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper113/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"We introduce and validate hierarchical local interpretations, the first technique to automatically search for and display important interactions for individual predictions made by LSTMs and CNNs.","pdf":"/pdf/89bd60d48fef0cc6f0b239bda4028f24fca6b622.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|hierarchical_interpretations_for_neural_network_predictions","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019hierarchical,    \ntitle={Hierarchical interpretations for neural network predictions},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=SkEqro0ctQ},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"H1goBoR9F7","original":"SyxU3JiKKQ","number":114,"cdate":1538087746560,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087746560,"tmdate":1538156239330,"tddate":null,"forum":"H1goBoR9F7","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Dynamic Sparse Graph for Efficient Deep Learning","abstract":"We propose to execute deep neural networks (DNNs) with dynamic and sparse graph (DSG) structure for compressive memory and accelerative execution during both training and inference.

We propose two simple solutions that reduce overconfident errors of samples from an unknown novel distribution without drastically increasing evaluation time: (1) G-distillation, training an ensemble of classifiers and then distill into a single model using both labeled and unlabeled examples, or (2) NCR, reducing prediction confidence based on its novelty detection score. Experimentally, we investigate the overconfidence problem and evaluate our solution by creating \"familiar\" and \"novel\" test splits, where \"familiar\" are identically distributed with training and \"novel\" are not. We show that our solution yields more appropriate prediction confidences, on familiar and novel data, compared to single models and ensembles distilled on training data only.

To overcome this limitation, we present a framework within which instruction-conditional RL agents are trained using rewards obtained not from the environment, but from reward models which are jointly trained from expert examples. As reward models improve, they learn to accurately reward agents for completing tasks for environment configurations---and for instructions---not present amongst the expert data. This framework effectively separates the representation of what instructions require from how they can be executed. In a simple grid world, it enables an agent to learn a range of commands requiring interaction with blocks and understanding of spatial relations and underspecified abstract arrangements.

Specifically, we model it as a statistical sampling problem and identify that by sampling less correlated data, we can largely reduce the requirement of the number of data for statistics estimation in BN, which directly simplifies the reduction operations. Based on this conclusion, we propose two sampling strategies, “Batch Sampling” (randomly select several samples from each batch) and “Feature Sampling” (randomly select a small patch from each feature map of all samples), that take both computational efficiency and sample correlation into consideration. Furthermore, we introduce an extremely simple variant of BN, termed as Virtual Dataset Normalization (VDN), that can normalize the activations well with few synthetical random samples. All the proposed methods are evaluated on various datasets and networks, where an overall training speedup by up to 20% on GPU is practically achieved without the support of any specialized libraries, and the loss on accuracy and convergence rate are negligible.

Nevertheless, most existing methods work in the so-called closed-set scenario, assuming that the classes depicted by the target images are exactly the same as those of the source domain. In this paper, we tackle the more challenging, yet more realistic case of open-set domain adaptation, where new, unknown classes can be present in the target data. While, in the unsupervised scenario, one cannot expect to be able to identify each specific new class, we aim to automatically detect which samples belong to these new classes and discard them from the recognition process. To this end, we rely on the intuition that the source and target samples depicting the known classes can be generated by a shared subspace, whereas the target samples from unknown classes come from a different, private subspace. We therefore introduce a framework that factorizes the data into shared and private parts, while encouraging the shared representation to be discriminative.

In effect, meta-reinforcement learning offloads the design burden from algorithm design to task design.

Though GAN has led to significant improvements in the data representations, it still has several problems such as unstable training, hidden manifold of data, and huge computational overhead. GAN tends to produce the data simply without any information about the manifold of the data, which hinders from controlling desired features to generate. Moreover, most of GAN’s have a large size of manifold, resulting in poor scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN to control the latent semantic representation, called LSC-GAN, which allows us to produce desired data to generate and learns a representation of the data efficiently. Unlike the conventional GAN models with hidden distribution of latent space, we define the distributions explicitly in advance that are trained to generate the data based on the corresponding features by inputting the latent variables that follow the distribution. As the larger scale of latent space caused by deploying various distributions in one latent space makes training unstable while maintaining the dimension of latent space, we need to separate the process of defining the distributions explicitly and operation of generation. We prove that a VAE is proper for the former and modify a loss function of VAE to map the data into the pre-defined latent space so as to locate the reconstructed data as close to the input data according to its characteristics. Moreover, we add the KL divergence to the loss function of LSC-GAN to include this process. The decoder of VAE, which generates the data with the corresponding features from the pre-defined latent space, is used as the generator of the LSC-GAN. Several experiments on the CelebA dataset are conducted to verify the usefulness of the proposed method to generate desired data stably and efficiently, achieving a high compression ratio that can hold about 24 pixels of information in each dimension of latent space. Besides, our model learns the reverse of features such as not laughing (rather frowning) only with data of ordinary and smiling facial expression.","keywords":["Latent space","Generative adversarial network","variational autoencoder","conditioned generation"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper140/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"We propose a generative model that not only produces data with desired features from the pre-defined latent space but also fully understands the features of the data to create characteristics that are not in the dataset.","pdf":"/pdf/35c7239a229fd9030f0d906a93428001abde9917.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|learning_latent_semantic_representation_from_predefined_generative_model","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019learning,    \ntitle={Learning Latent Semantic Representation from Pre-defined Generative Model},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=Hyg1Ls0cKQ},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"HJG1Uo09Fm","original":"SylE1PAqYQ","number":141,"cdate":1538087751466,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087751466,"tmdate":1538156233608,"tddate":null,"forum":"HJG1Uo09Fm","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Learning to Reinforcement Learn by Imitation","abstract":"Meta-reinforcement learning aims to learn fast reinforcement learning (RL) procedures that can be applied to new tasks or environments.

In this paper, we propose to learn a fast reinforcement learning procedure through supervised imitation of an expert, such that, after meta-learning, an agent can quickly learn new tasks through trial-and-error. Through our proposed method, we show that it is possible to learn fast RL using demonstrations, rather than relying on slow RL, where expert agents can be trained quickly by using privileged information or off-policy RL methods.

For achieving optimal coordination among these agents, we train a super agent (i.e., the manager) to manage them by first inferring their minds based on both current and past observations and then initiating contracts to assign suitable tasks to workers and promise to reward them with corresponding bonuses so that they will agree to work together. The objective of the manager is maximizing the overall productivity as well as minimizing payments made to the workers for ad-hoc worker teaming. To train the manager, we propose Mind-aware Multi-agent Management Reinforcement Learning (M^3RL), which consists of agent modeling and policy learning. We have evaluated our approach in two environments,  Resource Collection and Crafting, to simulate multi-agent management problems with various task settings and multiple designs for the worker agents.

Furthermore, a major hope is that knowledge may transfer across tasks, so that multi-task learning can improve generalization on individual tasks. However we lack analytic theories that can quantitatively predict how the degree of knowledge transfer depends on the relationship between the tasks. We develop an analytic theory of the nonlinear dynamics of generalization in deep linear networks, both within and across tasks. In particular, our theory provides analytic solutions to the training and testing error of deep networks as a function of training time, number of examples, network size and initialization, and the task structure and SNR. Our theory reveals that deep networks progressively learn the most important task structure first, so that generalization error at the early stopping time primarily depends on task structure and is independent of network size. This suggests any tight bound on generalization error must take into account task structure, and explains observations about real data being learned faster than random data. Intriguingly our theory also reveals the existence of a learning algorithm that proveably out-performs neural network training through gradient descent. Finally, for transfer learning, our theory reveals that knowledge transfer depends sensitively, but computably, on the SNRs and input feature alignments of pairs of tasks.","keywords":["Generalization","Theory","Transfer","Multi-task","Linear"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper155/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"We provide many insights into neural network generalization from the theoretically tractable linear case.","pdf":"/pdf/0e06ca160c49705b35c04f8a20bd05bdd8c11ddf.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|an_analytic_theory_of_generalization_dynamics_and_transfer_learning_in_deep_linear_networks","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019an,    \ntitle={An analytic theory of generalization dynamics and transfer learning in deep linear networks},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=ryfMLoCqtQ},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"SyEGUi05Km","original":"SJlSCQOPF7","number":156,"cdate":1538087754247,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087754247,"tmdate":1538156230524,"tddate":null,"forum":"SyEGUi05Km","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"CrystalGAN: Learning to Discover Crystallographic Structures with Generative Adversarial Networks","abstract":"Our main motivation is to propose an efficient approach to generate novel multi-element stable chemical compounds that can be used in real world applications.

We focused on the disentangled representation of sequential data because there is a wide range of potential applications if disentanglement representation is extended to sequential data such as video, speech, and stock price data. Sequential data is characterized by dynamic factors and static factors: dynamic factors are time-dependent, and static factors are independent of time. Previous works succeed in disentangling static factors and dynamic factors by explicitly modeling the priors of latent variables to distinguish between static and dynamic factors. However, this model can not disentangle representations between dynamic factors, such as disentangling ”picking” and ”throwing” in robotic tasks. In this paper, we propose new model that can disentangle multiple dynamic factors. Since our method does not require modeling priors, it is capable of disentangling ”between” dynamic factors.

This paper presents a deep neural network that integrates the flow network into the frame interpolation problem, with end-to-end learning. The proposed approach exploits the relationship between the two problems for quality enhancement of interpolation frames. Unlike recent convolutional neural networks, the proposed approach learns motions from natural video frames without graphical ground truth flows for training. This makes the network learn from extensive data and improve the performance. The motion information from the flow network guides interpolator networks to be trained to synthesize the interpolated frame accurately from motion scenarios. In addition, diverse datasets to cover various challenging cases that previous interpolations usually fail in is used for comparison.

In this study, we propose a framework for training networks that eliminates subsidiary information via the adversarial process. The objective of the proposed framework is to train a primary model that is robust to existing subsidiary information. This primary model can be used for various recognition tasks, such as digit recognition and speaker identification. Subsidiary information refers to the factors that might decrease the performance of the primary model such as channel information in speaker recognition and noise information in digit recognition.\nOur proposed framework comprises two discriminative models for the primary and subsidiary task, as well as an encoder network for feature representation. A subsidiary task is an operation associated with subsidiary information such as identifying the noise type. The discriminative model for the subsidiary task is trained for modeling the dependency of subsidiary class labels on codes from the encoder. Therefore, we expect that subsidiary information could be eliminated by training the encoder to reduce the dependency between the class labels and codes. In order to do so, we train the weight parameters of the subsidiary model; then, we develop the codes and the parameters of subsidiary model to make them orthogonal. For this purpose, we design a loss function to train the encoder based on cosine similarity between the weight parameters of the subsidiary model and codes. Finally, the proposed framework involves repeatedly performing the adversarial process of modeling the subsidiary information and eliminating it. Furthermore, we discuss possible applications of the proposed framework: reducing channel information for speaker identification and domain information for unsupervised domain adaptation.

Unfortunately, for the time being, the real goal of predictive uncertainty has been swept under the rug. Indeed, Bayesian approaches are solely evaluated in terms of raw performance of the prediction, while the quality of the estimated uncertainty is not assessed. One contribution of this article is to draw attention on existing metrics developed in the forecast community, designed to evaluate both the sharpness and the calibration of predictive uncertainty. Sharpness refers to the concentration of the predictive distributions and calibration to the consistency between the predicted uncertainty level and the actual errors. We further analyze the behavior of these metrics on regression problems when deep convolutional networks are involved and for several current predictive uncertainty approaches. A second contribution of this article is to propose an alternative metric that is more adapted to the evaluation of relative uncertainty assessment and directly applicable to regression with deep learning. This metric is evaluated and compared with existing ones on a toy dataset as well as on the problem of monocular depth estimation.

A widely-shared feature of distributed optimization techniques is the requirement that all nodes complete their assigned tasks in each computational epoch before the system can proceed to the next epoch. In such settings, slow nodes, called stragglers, can greatly slow progress. To mitigate the impact of stragglers, we propose an online distributed optimization method called Anytime Minibatch. In this approach, all nodes are given a fixed time to compute the gradients of as many data samples as possible. The result is a variable per-node minibatch size. Workers then get a fixed communication time to average their minibatch gradients via several rounds of consensus, which are then used to update primal variables via dual averaging. Anytime Minibatch prevents stragglers from holding up the system without wasting the work that stragglers can complete. We present a convergence analysis and analyze the wall time performance. We evaluate the method empirically using the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and observe a 30-50% improvement in convergence speed.","keywords":["distributed optimization","gradient descent","minibatch","stragglers"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper184/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"Accelerate distributed optimization by exploiting stragglers.","pdf":"/pdf/c0e6e7035199a140686777cadba87d94e7666942.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|anytime_minibatch_exploiting_stragglers_in_online_distributed_optimization","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019anytime,    \ntitle={ANYTIME MINIBATCH: EXPLOITING STRAGGLERS IN ONLINE DISTRIBUTED OPTIMIZATION},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=rkzDIiA5YQ},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"ryxDUs05KQ","original":"HJlb1wAOYm","number":185,"cdate":1538087759372,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087759372,"tmdate":1538156224413,"tddate":null,"forum":"ryxDUs05KQ","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Difference-Seeking Generative Adversarial Network","abstract":"We propose a novel algorithm, Difference-Seeking Generative Adversarial Network (DSGAN), developed from traditional GAN.

Furthermore, conditional GANs allow us to control the image generation process through labels or even natural language descriptions. However, fine-grained control of the image layout, i.e. where in the image specific objects should be located, is still difficult to achieve. This is especially true for images that should contain multiple distinct objects at different spatial locations. We introduce a new approach which allows us to control the location of arbitrarily many objects within an image by adding an object pathway to both the generator and the discriminator. Our approach does not need a detailed semantic layout but only bounding boxes and the respective labels of the desired objects are needed. The object pathway focuses solely on the individual objects and is iteratively applied at the locations specified by the bounding boxes. The global pathway focuses on the image background and the general image layout. We perform experiments on the Multi-MNIST, CLEVR, and the more complex MS-COCO data set. Our experiments show that through the use of the object pathway we can control object locations within images and can model complex scenes with multiple objects at various locations. We further show that the object pathway focuses on the individual objects and learns features relevant for these, while the global pathway focuses on global image characteristics and the image background.","keywords":["controllable image generation","text-to-image synthesis","generative model","generative adversarial network","gan"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper187/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"Extend GAN architecture to obtain control over locations and identities of multiple objects within generated images.","pdf":"/pdf/c4fb3982d7eb947bf262e2fef60a5a1006167427.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|generating_multiple_objects_at_spatially_distinct_locations","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019generating,    \ntitle={Generating Multiple Objects at Spatially Distinct Locations},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=H1edIiA9KQ},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"HyxOIoRqFQ","original":"S1eB6ftIYQ","number":188,"cdate":1538087759917,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087759917,"tmdate":1538156223792,"tddate":null,"forum":"HyxOIoRqFQ","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Discrete flow posteriors for variational inference in discrete dynamical systems","abstract":"Each training step for a variational autoencoder (VAE) requires us to sample from the approximate posterior, so we usually choose simple (e.g. factorised) approximate posteriors in which sampling is an efficient computation that fully exploits GPU parallelism.  However, such simple approximate posteriors are often insufficient, as they eliminate statistical dependencies in the posterior.  While it is possible to use normalizing flow approximate posteriors for continuous latents, there is nothing analogous for discrete latents. The most natural approach to model discrete dependencies is an autoregressive distribution, but sampling from such distributions is inherently sequential and thus slow.  We develop a fast, parallel sampling procedure for autoregressive distributions based on fixed-point iterations which enables efficient and accurate variational inference in discrete state-space models.  To optimize the variational bound, we considered two ways to evaluate probabilities: inserting the relaxed samples directly into the pmf for the discrete distribution, or converting to continuous logistic latent variables and interpreting the K-step fixed-point iterations as a normalizing flow.  We found that converting to continuous latent variables gave considerable additional scope for mismatch between the true and approximate posteriors, which resulted in biased inferences, we thus used the former approach.  We tested our approach on the neuroscience problem of inferring discrete spiking activity from noisy calcium-imaging data, and found that it gave accurate connectivity estimates in an order of magnitude less time.","keywords":["normalising flow","variational inference","discrete latent variable"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper188/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"We give a fast normalising-flow like sampling procedure for discrete latent variable models.","pdf":"/pdf/23c6900cad7a39c3d5bca6e26ec50c7ec825f51e.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|discrete_flow_posteriors_for_variational_inference_in_discrete_dynamical_systems","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019discrete,    \ntitle={Discrete flow posteriors for variational inference in discrete dynamical systems},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=HyxOIoRqFQ},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"HJguLo0cKQ","original":"Bye1JPBtFQ","number":189,"cdate":1538087760096,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087760096,"tmdate":1538156223578,"tddate":null,"forum":"HJguLo0cKQ","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Strength in Numbers: Trading-off Robustness and Computation via Adversarially-Trained Ensembles","abstract":"While deep learning has led to remarkable results on a number of challenging problems, researchers have discovered a vulnerability of neural networks in adversarial settings, where small but carefully chosen perturbations to the input can make the models produce extremely inaccurate outputs.

Conventional agent modeling relies on passive observation from demonstrations. In this work, we propose an interactive agent modeling scheme enabled by encouraging an agent to learn to probe. In particular, the probing agent (i.e. a learner) learns to interact with the environment and with a target agent (i.e., a demonstrator) to maximize the change in the observed behaviors of that agent. Through probing, rich behaviors can be observed and are used for enhancing the agent modeling to learn a more accurate mind model of the target agent. Our framework consists of two learning processes: i) imitation learning for an approximated agent model and ii) pure curiosity-driven reinforcement learning for an efficient probing policy to discover new behaviors that otherwise can not be observed. We have validated our approach in four different tasks. The experimental results suggest that the agent model learned by our approach i) generalizes better in novel scenarios than the ones learned by passive observation, random probing, and other curiosity-driven approaches do, and ii) can be used for enhancing performance in multiple applications including distilling optimal planning to a policy net, collaboration, and competition.

Previous off-policy RL algorithms mitigated this issue by tuning hyper-parameters in order to abate policy changes.

In real-world environments, the more an IL method requires the learner to interact with the environment for better imitation, the more training time it requires, and the more damage to the environments and the learner it causes.

Performing forward prediction on sequences of distributions has many important applications. However, there are two main challenges in designing a network model for this task. First, neural networks are unable to encode distributions compactly as each node encodes just a real value. A recent work of Distribution Regression Network (DRN) solved this problem with a novel network that encodes an entire distribution in a single node, resulting in improved accuracies while using much fewer parameters than neural networks. However, despite its compact distribution representation, DRN does not address the second challenge, which is the need to model time dependencies in a sequence of distributions. In this paper, we propose our Recurrent Distribution Regression Network (RDRN) which adopts a recurrent architecture for DRN. The combination of compact distribution representation and shared weights architecture across time steps makes RDRN suitable for modeling the time dependencies in a distribution sequence.

Inspired by the prediction error minimization (PEM) and embodied cognition, we propose a simple architecture to augment reward, namely Imagination Reconstruction Network (IRN). Speciﬁcally, IRN enables the agent to explore its environment and learn predictive representations via three key components. The imagination core generates predicted trajectories, i.e., imagined items that users may purchase. The trajectory manager controls the granularity of imagined trajectories using the planning strategies, which balances the long-term rewards and short-term rewards. To optimize the action policy, the imagination-augmented executor minimizes the intrinsic imagination error of simulated trajectories by self-supervised reconstruction, while maximizing the extrinsic reward using model-free algorithms. Empirically, IRN promotes quicker adaptation to user interest, and shows improved robustness to the cold-start scenario and ultimately higher purchase performance compared to several baselines.

With wide recognition of potential advantages, why is it that variational Bayes has seen very limited practical use for BNNs in real applications? We argue that variational inference in neural networks is fragile: successful implementations require careful initialization and tuning of prior variances, as well as controlling the variance of Monte Carlo gradient estimates. We fix VB and turn it into a robust inference tool for Bayesian neural networks. We achieve this with two innovations: first, we introduce a novel deterministic method to approximate moments in neural networks, eliminating gradient variance; second, we introduce a hierarchical prior for parameters and a novel Empirical Bayes procedure for automatically selecting prior variances. Combining these two innovations, the resulting method is highly efficient and robust. On the application of heteroscedastic regression we demonstrate strong predictive performance over alternative approaches.","keywords":["Bayesian neural network","variational inference","variational bayes","variance reduction","empirical bayes"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper220/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"A method for eliminating gradient variance and automatically tuning priors for effective training of bayesian neural networks","pdf":"/pdf/1f875de3aae49de60cc1d37a72c8d2c177d0c2f8.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|fixing_variational_bayes_deterministic_variational_inference_for_bayesian_neural_networks","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019fixing,    \ntitle={Fixing Variational Bayes: Deterministic Variational Inference for Bayesian Neural Networks},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=B1l08oAct7},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"HyMRUiC9YX","original":"B1egmPLKt7","number":221,"cdate":1538087765961,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087765961,"tmdate":1538156216753,"tddate":null,"forum":"HyMRUiC9YX","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Exploring and Enhancing the Transferability of Adversarial Examples","abstract":"  State-of-the-art deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, formed by applying small but malicious perturbations to the original inputs.

To validate our hypothesis, we derive a theoretical bound on the amount of information stored in a RAM-like system and formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the bound.

Biological networks, on the other hand, appear to lack any mechanism for sending gradients back to their input neurons, and thus cannot be learning in this way. In response to this, Scellier & Bengio (2017) proposed Equilibrium Propagation - a method for gradient-based train- ing of neural networks which uses only local learning rules and, crucially, does not rely on neurons having a mechanism for back-propagating an error gradient. Equilibrium propagation, however, has a major practical limitation: inference involves doing an iterative optimization of neural activations to find a fixed-point, and the number of steps required to closely approximate this fixed point scales poorly with the depth of the network. In response to this problem, we propose Initialized Equilibrium Propagation, which trains a feedforward network to initialize the iterative inference procedure for Equilibrium propagation. This feed-forward network learns to approximate the state of the fixed-point using a local learning rule. After training, we can simply use this initializing network for inference, resulting in a learned feedforward network. Our experiments show that this network appears to work as well or better than the original version of Equilibrium propagation. This shows how we might go about training deep networks without using backpropagation.","keywords":["credit assignment","energy-based models","biologically plausible learning"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper245/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"We train a feedforward network without backprop by using an energy-based model to provide local targets","pdf":"/pdf/03167fbf8b66fd7df9b34bfb28e32c26a9907959.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|initialized_equilibrium_propagation_for_backpropfree_training","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019initialized,    \ntitle={Initialized Equilibrium Propagation for Backprop-Free Training},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=B1GMDsR5tm},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"rJEGwo0cFX","original":"rylrGRUctm","number":246,"cdate":1538087770423,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087770423,"tmdate":1538156211410,"tddate":null,"forum":"rJEGwo0cFX","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"An Attention-Based Model for Learning Dynamic Interaction Networks","abstract":"While machine learning models achieve human-comparable performance on sequential data, exploiting structured knowledge is still a challenging problem.

These results are unexpected given the fact that, in supervised learning, deep neural networks often learn robust features that generalize across tasks. In this paper, we study the generalization capabilities of DQN in order to aid in understanding this mismatch between generalization in deep RL and supervised learning methods. We provide evidence suggesting that DQN overspecializes to the domain it is trained on. We then comprehensively evaluate the impact of traditional methods of regularization from supervised learning, $\\ell_2$ and dropout, and of reusing learned representations to improve the generalization capabilities of DQN. We perform this study using different game modes of Atari 2600 games, a recently introduced modification for the ALE which supports slight variations of the Atari 2600 games used for benchmarking in the field. Despite regularization being largely underutilized in deep RL, we show that it can, in fact, help DQN learn more general features. These features can then be reused and fine-tuned on similar tasks, considerably improving the sample efficiency of DQN.","keywords":["generalization","reinforcement learning","dqn","regularization","transfer learning","multitask"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper250/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"We study the generalization capabilities of DQN using the new modes and difficulties of Atari games.

However, in the context of autonomous vehicle (AV) control, requiring an agent to make mistakes, or even allowing mistakes, can be quite dangerous and costly in the real world. For this reason, AV RL is generally only viable in simulation. Because these simulations have imperfect representations, particularly with respect to graphics, physics, and human interaction, we find motivation for a framework similar to RL, suitable to the real world. To this end, we formulate a learning framework that learns from restricted exploration by having a human demonstrator do the exploration. Existing work on learning from demonstration typically either assumes the collected data is performed by an optimal expert, or requires potentially dangerous exploration to find the optimal policy. We propose an alternative framework that learns continuous control from only safe behavior. One of our key insights is that the problem becomes tractable if the feedback score that rates the demonstration applies to the atomic action, as opposed to the entire sequence of actions. We use human experts to collect driving data as well as to label the driving data through a framework we call ``Backseat Driver'', giving us state-action pairs matched with scalar values representing the score for the action. We call the more general learning framework ReNeg, since it learns a regression from states to actions given negative as well as positive examples. We empirically validate several models in the ReNeg framework, testing on lane-following with limited data. We find that the best solution in this context outperforms behavioral cloning has strong connections to stochastic policy gradient approaches.","TL;DR":"We introduce a novel framework for learning from demonstration that uses continuous human feedback; we evaluate this framework on continuous control for autonomous vehicles.","authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper251/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"keywords":["learning from demonstration","imitation learning","behavioral cloning","reinforcement learning","off-policy","continuous control","autonomous vehicles","deep learning","machine learning","policy gradient"],"pdf":"/pdf/71f382c6c6edd89ab52ebf36cafba2a3e46270fe.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|reneg_and_backseat_driver_learning_from_demonstration_with_continuous_human_feedback","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019reneg,    \ntitle={ReNeg and Backseat Driver: Learning from demonstration with continuous human feedback},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=SJl7DsR5YQ},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"rJxXDsCqYX","original":"HklUIDw9tm","number":252,"cdate":1538087771494,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087771494,"tmdate":1538156210162,"tddate":null,"forum":"rJxXDsCqYX","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Sentence Encoding with Tree-Constrained Relation Networks","abstract":"The meaning of a sentence is a function of the relations that hold between its words.

We still, though, do not yet have a clear understanding of how the choice of pretraining objective affects the type of linguistic information that models learn. With this in mind, we compare four objectives - language modeling, translation, skip-thought, and autoencoding - on their ability to induce syntactic and part-of-speech information.  We make a fair comparison between the tasks by holding constant the quantity and genre of the training data, as well as the LSTM architecture.

To address this question, authors have proposed different approaches aiming at increasing the robustness of DNNs, such as adding regularizers or training using noisy examples. In this paper we propose a new regularizer built upon the Laplacian of similarity graphs obtained from the representation of training data at each layer of the DNN architecture. This regularizer penalizes large changes (across consecutive layers in the architecture) in the distance between examples of different classes, and as such enforces smooth variations of the class boundaries. Since it is agnostic to the type of deformations that are expected when predicting with the DNN, the proposed regularizer can be combined with existing ad-hoc methods.

In result, distributed training schemes are becoming increasingly relevant. A major issue in distributed training is the limited communication bandwidth between contributing nodes or prohibitive communication cost in general. \n%These challenges become even more pressing, as the number of computation nodes increases. \nTo mitigate this problem we propose Sparse Binary Compression (SBC), a compression framework that allows for a drastic reduction of communication cost for distributed training. SBC combines existing techniques of communication delay and gradient sparsification with a novel binarization method and optimal weight update encoding to push compression gains to new limits. By doing so, our method also allows us to smoothly trade-off gradient sparsity and temporal sparsity to adapt to the requirements of the learning task. \n%We use tools from information theory to reason why SBC can achieve the striking compression rates observed in the experiments.\nOur experiments show, that SBC can reduce the upstream communication on a variety of convolutional and recurrent neural network architectures by more than four orders of magnitude without significantly harming the convergence speed in terms of forward-backward passes. For instance, we can train ResNet50 on ImageNet in the same number of iterations to the baseline accuracy, using $\\times 3531$ less bits or train it to a $1\\%$ lower accuracy using $\\times 37208$ less bits.

Recently, Morcos et al. (2018) examined the effect of class-selective units in DNNs, i.e., units with high-level selectivity, on network generalization, concluding that hidden units that are selectively activated by specific input patterns may harm the network's performance. In this study, we revisit their hypothesis, considering units with selectivity for lower-level features, and argue that selective units are not always harmful to the network performance. Specifically, by using DNNs trained for image classification, we analyzed the orientation selectivity of individual units. Orientation selectivity is a low-level selectivity widely studied in visual neuroscience, in which, when images of bars with several orientations are presented to the eye, many neurons in the visual cortex respond selectively to a specific orientation. We found that orientation-selective units exist in both lower and higher layers of DNNs, as in our brain. In particular, units in the lower layers become more orientation-selective as the generalization performance improves during the course of training of the DNNs. Consistently, networks that generalize better are more orientation-selective in the lower layers. We finally reveal that ablating these selective units in the lower layers substantially degrades the generalization performance. These results suggest to the machine-learning community that, contrary to the triviality of units with high-level selectivity, lower-layer units with selectivity for low-level features are indispensable for generalization, and for neuroscientists, orientation selectivity does play a causally important role in object recognition.","keywords":["deep learning","neuroscience"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper276/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"pdf":"/pdf/a752d8113afe031c5afb9ce05d3238c8ef51108c.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|causal_importance_of_orientation_selectivity_for_generalization_in_image_recognition","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019causal,    \ntitle={Causal importance of orientation selectivity for generalization in image recognition},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=Bkx_Dj09tQ},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"BkedwoC5t7","original":"Hke1cQ_qtQ","number":277,"cdate":1538087775945,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087775945,"tmdate":1538156204908,"tddate":null,"forum":"BkedwoC5t7","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Formal Limitations on the Measurement of Mutual Information","abstract":"Maximum mutual information (MMI) predictive coding has recently been proposed as a compelling approach to self-supervised learning.

Specifically, the Bayesian probability distribution\nof parameters (weights) of a probabilistic model given by a neural network is estimated via recurrent variational approximations. Derived recurrent update rules correspond to SGD-type rules for finding a minimum of an effective loss that is an average of an original negative log-likelihood over the Gaussian distributions of weights, which makes it a function of means and variances. The effective loss is convex for large variances and non-convex in the limit of small variances. Among stationary solutions of the update rules there are trivial solutions with zero variances at local minima of the original loss and a single non-trivial solution with finite variances that is a critical point at the end of convexity of the effective loss\nin the mean-variance space. At the critical point both first- and second-order gradients of the effective loss w.r.t. means are zero.

The central challenge is to find an explanation which is more comprehensible than the original model while still representing that model faithfully. The distributed nature of deep networks has led many to believe that the hidden features of a neural network cannot be explained by logical descriptions simple enough to be understood by humans, and that decompositional knowledge extraction should be abandoned in favour of other methods. In this paper we examine this question systematically by proposing a knowledge extraction method using M-of-N rules which allows us to map the complexity/accuracy landscape of rules describing hidden features in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Experiments reported in this paper show that the shape of this landscape reveals an optimal trade off between comprehensibility and accuracy, showing that each latent variable has an optimal M-of-N rule to describe its behaviour. We find that the rules with optimal tradeoff in the first and final layer have a high degree of explainability whereas the rules with the optimal tradeoff in the second and third layer are less explainable. Furthermore, we show that by replacing the final layer with the optimal extracted rules the network becomes more robust against adversarial examples. The results shed light on the feasibility of rule extraction from deep networks, and point to the value of decompositional knowledge extraction as a method of explainability and to improve robustness when applied selectively.","keywords":["Deep Networks","Explainability","Knowledge Extraction"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper285/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"Systematically examines how well we can explain the hidden features of a deep network in terms of logical rules.","pdf":"/pdf/731f97d79b23915ff97d060d9a5c8b4cf474dc89.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|characterizing_the_accuracycomplexity_landscape_of_explanations_of_deep_networks_through_knowledge_extraction","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019characterizing,    \ntitle={Characterizing the Accuracy/Complexity Landscape of Explanations of Deep Networks through Knowledge Extraction},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=ByEtPiAcY7},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"Sklqvo0qt7","original":"rygIyeScKQ","number":286,"cdate":1538087777559,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087777559,"tmdate":1538156202900,"tddate":null,"forum":"Sklqvo0qt7","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"A Priori Estimates  of the Generalization Error for Two-layer Neural Networks","abstract":"New estimates for the generalization error are established for a nonlinear regression problem using a two-layer neural network model.

Such services require an end user to send data to the service provider, which presents a serious challenge to end-user privacy. To address this concern, prior works either add noise to the data or send features extracted from the raw data.  They struggle to balance between the utility and privacy because added noise reduces utility and raw data can be reconstructed from extracted features.\n\nThis work represents a methodical departure from prior works: we balance between a measure of privacy and another of utility by leveraging adversarial learning to find a sweeter tradeoff. We design an encoder that optimizes against the reconstruction error (a measure of privacy), adversarially by a Decoder, and the inference accuracy (a measure of utility) by a Classifier. The result is RAN, a novel deep model with a new training algorithm that automatically extracts features for classification that are both private and useful.  \n\nIt turns out that adversarially forcing the extracted features to only conveys the intended information required by classification leads to an implicit regularization leading to better classification accuracy than the original model which completely ignores privacy. Thus, we achieve better privacy with better utility, a surprising possibility in machine learning! We conducted extensive experiments on five popular datasets over four training schemes, and demonstrate the superiority of RAN compared with existing alternatives.","keywords":["end-user privacy","utility","feature learning","adversarial training"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper296/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"pdf":"/pdf/62c40ddaf4914669e40fa6748fc17b3f15110442.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|better_accuracy_with_quantified_privacy_representations_learned_via_reconstructive_adversarial_network","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019better,    \ntitle={Better Accuracy with Quantified Privacy: Representations Learned via Reconstructive Adversarial Network},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=BJesDsA9t7},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"BkGiPoC5FX","original":"Bye9rTuVtX","number":297,"cdate":1538087779506,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087779506,"tmdate":1538156200580,"tddate":null,"forum":"BkGiPoC5FX","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Efficient Convolutional Neural Network Training with Direct Feedback Alignment","abstract":"There were many algorithms to substitute the back-propagation (BP) in the deep neural network (DNN) training.

Well-crafted adversarial examples may even mislead state-of-the-art deep models to make wrong predictions easily. To alleviate this problem, many studies focus on investigating how adversarial examples can be generated and/or resisted. All the existing work handles this problem in the Euclidean space, which may however be unable to describe data geometry. In this paper, we propose a generalized framework that addresses the learning problem of adversarial examples with Riemannian geometry. Specifically, we define the local coordinate systems on Riemannian manifold, develop a novel model called Adversarial Training with Riemannian Manifold, and design a series of theory that manages to learn the adversarial examples in the Riemannian space feasibly and efficiently. The proposed work is important in that (1) it is a generalized learning methodology since Riemmanian manifold space would be degraded to the Euclidean space in a special case; (2) it is the first work to tackle the adversarial example problem tractably through the perspective of geometry; (3) from the perspective of geometry, our method leads to the steepest direction of the loss function. We also provide a series of theory showing that our proposed method can truly find the decent direction for the loss function with a comparable computational time against traditional adversarial methods. Finally, the proposed framework demonstrates superior performance to the traditional counterpart methods on benchmark data including MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN.","keywords":["Adversarial training","Adversarial examples","Riemannian Geometry","Machine Learning","Deep Learning"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper310/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"pdf":"/pdf/10afb3bee37d9afd310eaff0d26a31ef6f8c9f40.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|learning_adversarial_examples_with_riemannian_geometry","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019learning,    \ntitle={LEARNING ADVERSARIAL EXAMPLES WITH RIEMANNIAN GEOMETRY},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=H1lADsCcFQ},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"BJG0voC9YQ","original":"BkxG7daDtm","number":311,"cdate":1538087781962,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087781962,"tmdate":1538156196907,"tddate":null,"forum":"BJG0voC9YQ","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda: Counterfactually-Guided Policy Search","abstract":"Learning policies on data synthesized by models can in principle quench the thirst of reinforcement learning algorithms for large amounts of real experience, which is often costly to acquire. However, simulating plausible experience de novo is a hard problem for many complex environments, often resulting in biases for model-based policy evaluation and search. Instead of de novo synthesis of data, here we assume logged, real experience and model alternative outcomes of this experience under counterfactual actions, i.e. actions that were not actually taken. Based on this, we propose the Counterfactually-Guided Policy Search (CF-GPS) algorithm for learning policies in POMDPs from off-policy experience. It leverages structural causal models for counterfactual evaluation of arbitrary policies on individual off-policy episodes. CF-GPS can improve on vanilla model-based RL algorithms by making use of available logged data to de-bias model predictions. In contrast to off-policy algorithms based on Importance Sampling which re-weight data, CF-GPS leverages a model to explicitly consider alternative outcomes, allowing the algorithm to make better use of experience data. We find empirically that these advantages translate into improved policy evaluation and search results on a non-trivial grid-world task. Finally, we show that CF-GPS generalizes the previously proposed Guided Policy Search and that reparameterization-based algorithms such Stochastic Value Gradient can be interpreted as counterfactual methods.","keywords":["reinforcement learning","generative models","model-based reinforcement learning","causal inference"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper311/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"pdf":"/pdf/a9799de1625b5b91e6b3d4bd7e295bd4f4d753ea.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|woulda_coulda_shoulda_counterfactuallyguided_policy_search","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019woulda,,    \ntitle={Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda: Counterfactually-Guided Policy Search},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=BJG0voC9YQ},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"HJMRvsAcK7","original":"r1xC2LhvYQ","number":312,"cdate":1538087782131,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087782131,"tmdate":1538156196268,"tddate":null,"forum":"HJMRvsAcK7","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Dynamic Pricing on E-commerce Platform with Deep Reinforcement Learning","abstract":"Dynamic pricing problem has been studied for decades and varieties of methodologies were developed under different assumptions.

Then, we may employ early stopping or the small-loss trick to train them on selected instances. However, in such training procedures, deep neural networks inevitably memorize some noisy labels, which will degrade their generalization. In this paper, we propose a meta algorithm called Pumpout to overcome the problem of memorizing noisy labels. By using scaled stochastic gradient ascent, Pumpout actively squeezes out the negative effects of noisy labels from the training model, instead of passively forgetting these effects. We leverage Pumpout to upgrade two representative methods: MentorNet and Backward Correction.

In this paper, we develop a multi-modal one-class generative adversarial net- work based detector (MMOC-GAN) to distinguish anomalies from normal data (products).

The generator takes in a modified noise vector using a pseudo latent prior and generate samples at the low-density area of the given normal data to simulate the anomalies. The discriminator then is trained to distinguish the generate samples from the normal samples. Since the generated samples simulate the low density area for each modal, the discriminator could directly detect anomalies from normal data. Experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art one-class classification models and other anomaly detection methods on both normal data and anomalies accuracy, as well as the F1 score.

Since the synchronization of the local models or gradients can be a bottleneck for large-scale distributed training, compressing communication traffic has gained widespread attention recently.  Among several recent proposed compression algorithms, \nResidual Gradient Compression (RGC) is one of the most successful approaches---it can significantly compress the transmitting message size (0.1% of the gradient size) of each node and still preserve accuracy. However, the literature on compressing deep networks focuses almost exclusively on achieving good compression rate, while the efficiency of RGC in real implementation has been less investigated. In this paper, we develop an RGC method that achieves significant training time improvement in real-world multi-GPU systems. Our proposed RGC system design called RedSync, introduces a set of optimizations to reduce communication bandwidth while introducing limited overhead. We examine the performance of RedSync on two different multiple GPU platforms, including a supercomputer and a multi-card server. Our test cases include image classification on Cifar10 and ImageNet, and language modeling tasks on Penn Treebank and Wiki2 datasets.

Our method allows the model to identify out-of-distribution samples reliably.

To further increase the robustness and better capture shape priors, an external memory module is shared between different actors, providing an implicit mechanism for image information exchange. Finally, the patch-wise predictions are aggregated to a complete segmentation mask. We demonstrate the benefits of the new paradigm on a challenging lung segmentation problem based on chest X-Ray images, as well as on two synthetic tasks based on the MNIST dataset. On the X-Ray data, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with a significantly reduced model size compared to reference methods. In addition, we reduce the number of failure cases by at least half.","keywords":["memory networks","deep learning","medical image segmentation"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper328/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"Multiple virtual actors cooperating through shared memory solve medical image segmentation.","pdf":"/pdf/45eafa16ba64ffffd3a5f0aa884a777fb69fcde6.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|shamann_shared_memory_augmented_neural_networks","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019shamann:,    \ntitle={SHAMANN: Shared Memory Augmented Neural Networks},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=BJeWOi09FQ},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"SyxZOsA9tX","original":"BJePSQ-KFX","number":329,"cdate":1538087785095,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087785095,"tmdate":1538156191853,"tddate":null,"forum":"SyxZOsA9tX","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Accelerated Value Iteration via Anderson Mixing","abstract":"Accelerating reinforcement learning methods is an important and challenging topic.

Approaches using copy mechanisms and reinforcement learning have shown promising results, but there are ambiguities in the exact implementation that have not yet been investigated. We show that by removing inductive bias from the model and allowing the choice of generation path to become latent, we achieve substantial improvements over implementations biased with both naive and smart heuristics. We perform a human evaluation to confirm these findings. We show that although policy gradient methods may be used to decouple training from the ground truth and optimise directly for quality metrics that have previously been assumed to be good choices, these objectives are poorly aligned with human judgement and the model simply learns to exploit the weaknesses of the reward source.

Instead, we propose polar prototype networks, a class of networks that explicitly states the structure, i.e. the layout, of the output. The structure is defined by polar prototypes, points on the hypersphere of the output space. For classification, each class is described by a single polar prototype and they are a priori distributed with maximal separation and equal shares on the hypersphere.  Classes are assigned to prototypes randomly or based on semantic priors and training becomes a matter of minimizing angular distances between examples and their class prototypes. For regression, we show that training can be performed as a polar interpolation between two prototypes, arriving at a regression with higher-dimensional outputs. From empirical analysis, we find that polar prototype networks benefit from large margin separation and semantic class structure, while having a minimal description length in the output space.  While the structure is simple, the performance is on par with (classification) or better than (regression) standard network methods.

Recently, numerous methods have been proposed for continual learning, but due to differences in evaluation protocols it is difficult to directly compare their performance. To enable more meaningful comparisons, we identified three distinct continual learning scenarios based on whether task identity is known and, if it is not, whether it needs to be inferred. Performing the split and permuted MNIST task protocols according to each of these scenarios, we found that regularization-based approaches (e.g., elastic weight consolidation) failed when task identity needed to be inferred. In contrast, generative replay combined with distillation (i.e., using class probabilities as ''soft targets'') achieved superior performance in all three scenarios. In addition, we reduced the computational cost of generative replay by integrating the generative model into the main model by equipping it with generative feedback connections. This Replay-through-Feedback approach substantially shortened training time with no or negligible loss in performance. We believe this to be an important first step towards making the powerful technique of generative replay scalable to real-world continual learning applications.","keywords":["continual learning","generative models","replay","distillation","feedback connections"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper346/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"A structured comparison of recent methods for continual learning that turns into an argument for and extension of generative replay.","pdf":"/pdf/471c36ba139dacce099ccfad6de9ba6b88ae750a.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|generative_replay_with_feedback_connections_as_a_general_strategy_for_continual_learning","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019generative,    \ntitle={Generative replay with feedback connections as a general strategy for continual learning},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=ByGVui0ctm},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"r14EOsCqKX","original":"SkxY3CPKFX","number":347,"cdate":1538087788235,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087788235,"tmdate":1538156188099,"tddate":null,"forum":"r14EOsCqKX","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"A Closer Look at Deep Learning Heuristics: Learning rate restarts, Warmup and Distillation","abstract":"The convergence rate and final performance of common deep learning models have significantly benefited from recently proposed heuristics such as learning rate schedules, knowledge distillation, skip connections and normalization layers.

To test continual learning capabilities we consider a challenging 3D domain with an implicit sequence of tasks and sparse rewards.

We show that even the widely recognized and by far most successful L-inf defense by Madry et~al.

These results suggest that MNIST is far from being solved in terms of adversarial robustness. We present a novel robust classification model that performs analysis by synthesis using learned class-conditional data distributions. We derive bounds on the robustness and go to great length to empirically evaluate our model using maximally effective adversarial attacks by (a) applying decision-based, score-based, gradient-based and transfer-based attacks for several different Lp norms, (b) by designing a new attack that exploits the structure of our defended model and (c) by devising a novel decision-based attack that seeks to minimize the number of perturbed pixels (L0). The results suggest that our approach yields state-of-the-art robustness on MNIST against L0, L2 and L-inf perturbations and we demonstrate that most adversarial examples are strongly perturbed towards the perceptual boundary between the original and the adversarial class.","keywords":["adversarial examples","MNIST","robustness","deep learning","security"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper353/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"pdf":"/pdf/94fb836a75aa0971ce61aa8e1216449211a3a759.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|towards_the_first_adversarially_robust_neural_network_model_on_mnist","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019towards,    \ntitle={Towards the first adversarially robust neural network model on MNIST},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=S1EHOsC9tX},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"SkNSOjR9Y7","original":"Byxymjt9KX","number":354,"cdate":1538087789469,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087789469,"tmdate":1538156186634,"tddate":null,"forum":"SkNSOjR9Y7","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Training Variational Auto Encoders with Discrete Latent Representations using Importance Sampling","abstract":"The Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) is a popular generative \nlatent variable model that is often \napplied for representation learning.\nStandard VAEs assume continuous valued \nlatent variables and are trained by maximization\nof the evidence lower bound (ELBO).

However, it is expensive and time-consuming to manually label sufficient amount of training data. Therefore, it is important to develop algorithms that can leverage off-the-shelf labeled dataset to learn useful knowledge for the target task. While previous works mostly focus on transfer learning from a single source, we study multi-source transfer across domains and tasks (MS-DTT), in a semi-supervised setting. We propose GradMix, a model-agnostic method applicable to any model trained with gradient-based learning rule. GradMix transfers knowledge via gradient descent, by weighting and mixing the gradients from all sources during training. Our method follows a meta-learning objective, by assigning layer-wise weights to the source gradients, such that the combined gradient follows the direction that can minimize the loss for a small set of samples from the target dataset. In addition, we propose to adaptively adjust the learning rate for each mini-batch based on its importance to the target task, and a pseudo-labeling method to leverage the unlabeled samples in the target domain.

The proposed method, named as SnapQuant, has two intriguing features: (1) The posterior distribution is parameterized as a policy network trained with a reinforcement learning scheme. During the training phase, we generate binary weights on-the-fly since what we actually maintain is the policy network, and all the binary weights are used in a burn-after-reading style. At the testing phase, we can sample binary weight instances for a given recognition architecture from the learnt policy network. (2) The policy network, which has a nested parameter structure consisting of layer-wise, filter-wise and kernel-wise parameter sharing designs, is applicable to any neural network architecture.

Some architectures incorporate methods to reduce RNN state updates, therefore allowing the network to preserve memory over long temporal intervals. To address these problems of convergence, this paper proposes a timing-gated LSTM RNN model, called the Gaussian-gated LSTM (g-LSTM). The time gate controls when a neuron can be updated during training, enabling longer memory persistence and better error-gradient flow. This model captures long-temporal dependencies better than an LSTM and the time gate parameters can be learned even from non-optimal initialization values. Because the time gate limits the updates of the neuron state, the number of computes needed for the network update is also reduced. By adding a computational budget term to the training loss, we can obtain a network which further reduces the number of computes by at least 10x. Finally, by employing a temporal curriculum learning schedule for the g-LSTM, we can reduce the convergence time of the equivalent LSTM network on long sequences.","keywords":["time gate","faster convergence","trainability","rnn","computational budget"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper366/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"Gaussian-gated LSTM is a novel time-gated LSTM RNN network that enables faster and better training on long sequence data.","pdf":"/pdf/4a52cf3b1b4dbcb18fd4fedc9ee3bc298cc8b3f1.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|gaussiangated_lstm_improved_convergence_by_reducing_state_updates","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019gaussian-gated,    \ntitle={Gaussian-gated LSTM: Improved convergence by reducing state updates},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=r1eO_oCqtQ},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"HJeuOiRqKQ","original":"HkxudfwtK7","number":367,"cdate":1538087791762,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087791762,"tmdate":1538156183898,"tddate":null,"forum":"HJeuOiRqKQ","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Pooling Is Neither Necessary nor Sufficient for Appropriate Deformation Stability in CNNs","abstract":"Many of our core assumptions about how neural networks operate remain empirically untested. One common assumption is that convolutional neural networks need to be stable to small translations and deformations to solve image recognition tasks. For many years, this stability was baked into CNN architectures by incorporating interleaved pooling layers. Recently, however, interleaved pooling has largely been abandoned. This raises a number of questions: Are our intuitions about deformation stability right at all? Is it important? Is pooling necessary for deformation invariance? If not, how is deformation invariance achieved in its absence? In this work, we rigorously test these questions, and find that deformation stability in convolutional networks is more nuanced than it first appears: (1) Deformation invariance is not a binary property, but rather that different tasks require different degrees of deformation stability at different layers. (2) Deformation stability is not a fixed property of a network and is heavily adjusted over the course of training, largely through the smoothness of the convolutional filters. (3) Interleaved pooling layers are neither necessary nor sufficient for achieving the optimal form of deformation stability for natural image classification. (4) Pooling confers \\emph{too much} deformation stability for image classification at initialization, and during training, networks have to learn to \\emph{counteract} this inductive bias.

Pruning techniques and Winograd convolution are two typical methods to reduce the CNN computation. However, they cannot be directly combined because Winograd transformation fills in the sparsity resulting from pruning. Li et al. (2017) propose sparse Winograd convolution in which weights are directly pruned in the Winograd domain, but this technique is not very practical because Winograd-domain retraining requires low learning rates and hence significantly longer training time. Besides, Liu et al. (2018) move the ReLU function into the Winograd domain, which can help increase the weight sparsity but requires changes in the network structure. To achieve a high Winograd-domain weight sparsity without changing network structures, we propose a new pruning method, spatial-Winograd pruning. As the first step, spatial-domain weights are pruned in a structured way, which efficiently transfers the spatial-domain sparsity into the Winograd domain and avoids Winograd-domain retraining. For the next step, we also perform pruning and retraining directly in the Winograd domain but propose to use an importance factor matrix to adjust weight importance and weight gradients. This adjustment makes it possible to effectively retrain the pruned Winograd-domain network without changing the network structure.

Unlike classical supervised learning and online learning settings, in batch contextual bandit learning, one only has access to a collection of logged feedback from the actions taken by a historical policy, and expect to learn a policy that takes good actions in possibly unseen contexts. Such a batch learning setting is ubiquitous in online and interactive systems, such as ad platforms and recommendation systems. Existing approaches based on inverse propensity weights, such as Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) and Policy Optimizer for Exponential Models (POEM), enjoy unbiasedness but often suffer from large mean squared error. In this work, we introduce a new approach named Maximum Likelihood Inverse Propensity Scoring (MLIPS) for batch learning from logged bandit feedback. Instead of using the given historical policy as the proposal in inverse propensity weights, we estimate a maximum likelihood surrogate policy based on the logged action-context pairs, and then use this surrogate policy as the proposal. We prove that MLIPS is asymptotically unbiased, and moreover, has a smaller nonasymptotic mean squared error than IPS. Such an error reduction phenomenon is somewhat surprising as the estimated surrogate policy is less accurate than the given historical policy. Results on multi-label classification problems and a large-scale ad placement dataset demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of MLIPS. Furthermore, the proposed surrogate policy technique is complementary to existing error reduction techniques, and when combined, is able to consistently boost the performance of several widely used approaches.","keywords":["Causal inference","Policy Optimization","Non-asymptotic analysis"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper375/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"pdf":"/pdf/ab4ded7d5cc8d6bc936e32e2c404e011f2c53634.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|offpolicy_evaluation_and_learning_from_logged_bandit_feedback_error_reduction_via_surrogate_policy","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019off-policy,    \ntitle={Off-Policy Evaluation and Learning from Logged Bandit Feedback: Error Reduction via Surrogate Policy},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=HklKui0ct7},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"rJxY_oCqKQ","original":"rJe1bw2YK7","number":376,"cdate":1538087793462,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087793462,"tmdate":1538156182080,"tddate":null,"forum":"rJxY_oCqKQ","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"A Forensic Representation to Detect Non-Trivial Image Duplicates, and How it Applies to Semantic Segmentation","abstract":"Manipulation and re-use of images in scientific publications is a recurring problem, at present lacking a scalable solution.

We propose the Universal Marginaliser Importance Sampler (UM-IS) -- a hybrid inference scheme that combines the flexibility of a deep neural network trained on samples from the model and it inherits the asymptotic guarantees of importance sampling. We show how combining samples drawn from the graphical model with an appropriate masking function allows us to train a single neural network to approximate any of the corresponding conditional marginal distributions, and thus amortise the cost of inference. We demonstrate that the efficiency of importance sampling is significantly improved by using as the proposal distribution samples from the neural network. We also use the embeddings obtained from the proposed neural network and utilise them for different tasks such as clustering, classification and interpretation of relationships between the nodes.

However, it is often the case that data are abundant in some domains but scarce in others. Domain adaptation deals with the challenge of adapting a model trained from a data-rich source domain to perform well in a data-poor target domain. In general, this requires learning plausible mappings between domains. CycleGAN is a powerful framework that efficiently learns to map inputs from one domain to another using adversarial training and a cycle-consistency constraint. However, the conventional approach of enforcing cycle-consistency via reconstruction may be overly restrictive in cases where one or more domains have limited training data. In this paper, we propose an augmented cyclic adversarial learning model that enforces the cycle-consistency constraint via an external task specific model, which encourages the preservation of task-relevant content as opposed to exact reconstruction. We explore digit classification in a low-resource setting in supervised, semi and unsupervised situation, as well as high resource unsupervised. In low-resource supervised setting, the results show that our approach improves absolute performance by 14% and 4% when adapting SVHN to MNIST and vice versa, respectively, which outperforms unsupervised domain adaptation methods that require high-resource unlabeled target domain. Moreover, using only few unsupervised target data, our approach can still outperforms many high-resource unsupervised models. Our model also outperforms on USPS to MNIST and synthetic digit to SVHN for high resource unsupervised adaptation. In speech domains, we similarly adopt a speech recognition model from each domain as the task specific model. Our approach improves absolute performance of speech recognition by 2% for female speakers in the TIMIT dataset, where the majority of training samples are from male voices.","keywords":["Domain adaptation","generative adversarial network","cyclic adversarial learning","speech"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper380/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"A new cyclic adversarial learning augmented with auxiliary task model which improves domain adaptation performance in low resource supervised and unsupervised situations ","pdf":"/pdf/96a3ddeb3725d71be87f849c69353b50f58f8806.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|augmented_cyclic_adversarial_learning_for_domain_adaptation","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019augmented,    \ntitle={Augmented Cyclic Adversarial Learning for Domain Adaptation},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=B1G9doA9F7},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"ryEquiR9KX","original":"rJlN0BFqYm","number":381,"cdate":1538087794342,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087794342,"tmdate":1538156180973,"tddate":null,"forum":"ryEquiR9KX","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Applications of Gaussian Processes in Finance","abstract":"Estimating covariances between financial assets plays an important role in risk management.

Usually, the observations are concentrated on a small volume but the classifier provides definite predictions for the entire space. We propose constructing conformal prediction sets which contain a set of labels rather than a single label. These conformal prediction sets contain the true label with probability $1-\\alpha$. Our construction is based on $p(x|y)$ rather than $p(y|x)$ which results in a classifier that is very cautious: it outputs the null set --- meaning ``I don't know'' --- when the object does not resemble the training examples. An important property of our approach is that classes can be added or removed without having to retrain the classifier.

Though significant work has resulted in increased robustness of systems to these attacks, systems are still vulnerable to well-crafted attacks. To address this problem\nseveral adversarial attack detection methods have been proposed. However, system can still be vulnerable to adversarial samples that are designed to specifically evade these detection methods. One recent detection scheme that has shown good performance is based on uncertainty estimates derived from Monte-Carlo dropout ensembles. Prior Networks, a new method of estimating predictive uncertainty, have been shown to outperform Monte-Carlo dropout on a range of tasks. One of the advantages of this approach is that the behaviour of a Prior Network can be explicitly tuned to, for example, predict high uncertainty in regions where there are no training data samples. In this work Prior Networks are applied to adversarial attack detection using measures of uncertainty in a similar fashion to Monte-Carlo Dropout. Detection based on measures of uncertainty derived from DNNs and Monte-Carlo dropout ensembles are used as a baseline. Prior Networks are shown to significantly out-perform these baseline approaches over a range of adversarial attacks in both detection of whitebox and blackbox configurations.

Second, image and sound features are extracted from the data using pre-trained classifiers. Third, multimodal layers are introduced to extract features that are common to both the images and sounds. These layers are trained to extract similar features regardless of the input modality, such as images only, sounds only, and both images and sounds. Once the multimodal layers have been trained, features are extracted from input sounds and converted into image features using a feature-to-feature GAN. Finally, the generated image features are used to reconstruct images. Experimental results show that this method can successfully convert from the sound domain into the image domain. When we applied a pre-trained classifier to both the generated and original images, 31.9% of the examples had at least one of their top 10 labels in common, suggesting reasonably good image generation.

For instance, dropout has been known to improve performance by reducing co-adaptation, and representational sparsity has been argued as a good characteristic because many data-generation processes have only a small number of factors that are independent. In this work, we analytically and empirically investigate the popular characteristics of learned representations, including correlation, sparsity, dead unit, rank, and mutual information, and disprove many of the \\textit{conventional wisdom}. We first show that infinitely many Identical Output Networks (IONs) can be constructed for any deep network with a linear layer, where any invertible affine transformation can be applied to alter the layer's representation characteristics. The existence of ION proves that the correlation characteristics of representation can be either low or high for a well-performing network. Extensions to ReLU layers are provided, too. Then, we consider sparsity, dead unit, and rank to show that only loose relationships exist among the three characteristics. It is shown that a higher sparsity or additional dead units do not imply a better or worse performance when the rank of representation is fixed. We also develop a rank regularizer and show that neither representation sparsity nor lower rank is helpful for improving performance even when the data-generation process has only a small number of independent factors. Mutual information $I(\\z_l;\\x)$ and $I(\\z_l;\\y)$ are investigated as well, and we show that regularizers can affect $I(\\z_l;\\x)$ and thus indirectly influence the performance. Finally, we explain how a rich set of regularizers can be used as a powerful tool for performance tuning.

While it is desirable to use the same method to represent documents as well, unfortunately, the effectiveness is lost when representing long documents involving multiple sentences. One reason for this degradation is due to the fact that a longer document is likely to contain words from many different themes (or topics), and hence creating a single vector while ignoring all the thematic structure is unlikely to yield an effective representation of the document. This problem is less acute in single sentences and other short text fragments where presence of a single theme/topic is most likely. To overcome this problem, in this paper we present PSIF, a partitioned word averaging model to represent long documents. P-SIF retains the simplicity of simple weighted word averaging while taking a document's thematic structure into account. In particular, P-SIF learns topic-specific vectors from a document and finally concatenates them all to represent the overall document. Through our experiments over multiple real-world datasets and tasks, we demonstrate PSIF's effectiveness compared to simple weighted averaging and many other state-of-the-art baselines. We also show that PSIF is particularly effective in representing long multi-sentence documents.

Our approach performs pruning stage and hints stage iteratively to further improve the\nperformance. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to reconstruct the parameters of hints layer and make the pruned model more suitable for hints.

Alternative Training via a Soft-Quantization Network with Noisy-Natural Samples Only","abstract":"Recent work on adversarial attack and defense suggests that projected gradient descent (PGD) is a universal $l_\\infty$ first-order attack, and PGD adversarial training can significantly improve network robustness against a wide range of first-order $l_\\infty$-bounded attacks, represented as the state-of-the-art defense method. However, an obvious weakness of PGD adversarial training is its highly-computational cost in generating adversarial samples, making it computationally infeasible for large and high-resolution real datasets such as the ImageNet dataset. In addition, recent work also has suggested a simple ``close-form'' solution to a robust model on MNIST. Therefore, a natural question raised is that is PGD adversarial training really necessary for robust defense? In this paper, surprisingly, we give a negative answer by proposing a training paradigm that is comparable to PGD adversarial training on several standard datasets, while only using noisy-natural samples. Specifically, we reformulate the min-max objective in PGD adversarial training by a minimization problem to minimize the original network loss plus $l_1$ norms of its gradients evaluated on the inputs (including adversarial samples). The original loss can be solved by natural training; for the $l_1$-norm loss, we propose a computationally-feasible solution by embedding a differentiable soft-quantization layer after the input layer of a network. We show formally that the soft-quantization layer trained with noisy-natural samples is an alternative approach to minimizing the $l_1$-gradient norms as in PGD adversarial training. Extensive empirical evaluations on three standard datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show that our proposed models are comparable to PGD-adversarially-trained models under PGD and BPDA attacks using both cross-entropy and $CW_\\infty$ losses. Remarkably, our method achieves a 24X speed-up on MNIST while maintaining a comparable defensive ability, and for the first time fine-tunes a robust Imagenet model within only two days.

In this work, we propose the first zero-resource multilingual transfer learning model that can utilize training data in multiple source languages, while not requiring target language training data nor cross-lingual supervision. Unlike existing methods that only rely on language-invariant features for cross-lingual transfer, our approach utilizes both language-invariant and language-specific features in a coherent way. Our model leverages adversarial networks to learn language-invariant features and mixture-of-experts models to dynamically exploit the relation between the target language and each individual source language. This enables our model to learn effectively what to share between various languages in the multilingual setup.

The extent of the impairment depends on the onset and length of the deficit window, as in animal models, and on the size of the neural network. Deficits that do not affect low-level statistics, such as vertical flipping of the images, have no lasting effect on performance and can be overcome with further training.  To better understand this phenomenon, we use the Fisher Information of the weights to measure the effective connectivity between layers of a network during training.  Counterintuitively, information raises rapidly in the early phases of training, and then decreases, preventing redistribution of information resources in a phenomenon we refer to as a loss of \"Information Plasticity\".  Our analysis suggests that the first few epochs are critical for the creation of strong connections that are optimal relative to the input data distribution. Once such strong connections are created, they do not appear to change during additional training. These findings suggest that the initial learning transient, under-scrutinized compared to asymptotic behavior, plays a key role in determining the outcome of the training process. Our findings, combined with recent theoretical results in the literature, also suggest that forgetting (decrease of information in the weights) is critical to achieving invariance and disentanglement in representation learning. Finally, critical periods are not restricted to biological systems, but can emerge naturally in learning systems, whether biological or artificial, due to fundamental constrains arising from learning dynamics and information processing.","keywords":["Critical Period","Deep Learning","Information Theory","Artificial Neuroscience","Information Plasticity"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper443/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"Sensory deficits in early training phases can lead to irreversible performance loss in both artificial and neuronal networks, suggesting information phenomena as the common cause, and point to the importance of the initial transient and forgetting.","pdf":"/pdf/a597559605c420cee99dfb7eee7bf93d7da523b4.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|critical_learning_periods_in_deep_networks","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019critical,    \ntitle={Critical Learning Periods in Deep Networks},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=BkeStsCcKQ},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"ByxBFsRqYm","original":"H1xyGysqFX","number":444,"cdate":1538087805360,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087805360,"tmdate":1538156167881,"tddate":null,"forum":"ByxBFsRqYm","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Attention, Learn to Solve Routing Problems!","abstract":"The recently presented idea to learn heuristics for combinatorial optimization problems is promising as it can save costly development.

Methods for object localization, however, are still in need of substantial improvement. Common approaches to this problem involve the use of a sliding window, sometimes at multiple scales, providing input to a deep CNN trained to classify the contents of the window. In general, these approaches are time consuming, requiring many classification calculations. In this paper, we offer a fundamentally different approach to the localization of recognized objects in images. Our method is predicated on the idea that a deep CNN capable of recognizing an object must implicitly contain knowledge about object location in its connection weights. We provide a simple method to interpret classifier weights in the context of individual classified images. This method involves the calculation of the derivative of network generated activation patterns, such as the activation of output class label units, with regard to each in- put pixel, performing a sensitivity analysis that identifies the pixels that, in a local sense, have the greatest influence on internal representations and object recognition.

While current state-of-the-art methods employ control-variate schemes for the former and continuous-relaxation methods for the latter, their utility is limited by the complexities of implementing and training effective control-variate schemes and the necessity of evaluating (potentially exponentially) many branch paths in the model. Here, we revisit the Reweighted Wake Sleep (RWS; Bornschein and Bengio, 2015) algorithm, and through extensive evaluations, show that it circumvents both these issues, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods in learning discrete latent-variable models. Moreover, we observe that, unlike the Importance-weighted Autoencoder, RWS learns better models and inference networks with increasing numbers of particles, and that its benefits extend to continuous latent-variable models as well.

In particular, an infinite-size neural network enjoys the best generalization guarantees.

In the former, an agent learns a policy over R^d and in the latter, over a discrete set of actions each of which is parametrized by a continuous parameter. Such problems are naturally solved using policy based reinforcement learning (RL) methods, but unfortunately these often suffer from high variance leading to instability and slow convergence. Unnecessary variance is introduced whenever policies over bounded action spaces are modeled using distributions with unbounded support by applying a transformation T to the sampled action before execution in the environment. Recently, the variance reduced clipped action policy gradient (CAPG) was introduced for actions in bounded intervals, but to date no variance reduced methods exist when the action is a direction, something often seen in RTS games. To this end we introduce the angular policy gradient (APG), a stochastic policy gradient method for directional control. With the marginal policy gradients family of estimators we present a unified analysis of the variance reduction properties of APG and CAPG; our results provide a stronger guarantee than existing analyses for CAPG. Experimental results on a popular RTS game and a navigation task  show that the APG estimator offers a substantial improvement over the standard policy gradient.","keywords":["reinforcement learning","policy gradient","MOBA games"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper468/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"pdf":"/pdf/6f73e6967786c82b68c75dda9c351376849d8c0d.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|marginal_policy_gradients_a_unified_family_of_estimators_for_bounded_action_spaces_with_applications","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019marginal,    \ntitle={Marginal Policy Gradients: A Unified Family of Estimators for Bounded Action Spaces with Applications},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=HkgqFiAcFm},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"B1x5KiCcFX","original":"HylzxXi5tX","number":469,"cdate":1538087809762,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087809762,"tmdate":1538156162658,"tddate":null,"forum":"B1x5KiCcFX","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Understanding GANs via Generalization Analysis for Disconnected Support","abstract":"This paper provides theoretical analysis of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to explain its advantages over other standard methods of learning probability measures.

In this paper, we adapt and combine approaches such as DQN and DDPG in novel ways to outperform the earlier results for continuous state and action space problems.

This is exemplified by the adversarial examples phenomenon but can also be seen in terms of model generalization and domain shift.  Ideally, a model would assign lower confidence to points unlike those from the training distribution.  We propose a regularizer which addresses this issue by training with interpolated hidden states and encouraging the classifier to be less confident at these points.  Because the hidden states are learned, this has an important effect of encouraging the hidden states for a class to be concentrated in such a way so that interpolations within the same class or between two different classes do not intersect with the real data points from other classes.  This has a major advantage in that it avoids the underfitting which can result from interpolating in the input space.  We prove that the exact condition for this problem of underfitting to be avoided by Manifold Mixup is that the dimensionality of the hidden states exceeds the number of classes, which is often the case in practice.  Additionally, this concentration can be seen as making the features in earlier layers more discriminative.  We show that despite requiring no significant additional computation, Manifold Mixup achieves large improvements over strong baselines in supervised learning, robustness to single-step adversarial attacks, semi-supervised learning, and Negative Log-Likelihood on held out samples.","keywords":["Regularizer","Supervised Learning","Semi-supervised Learning","Better representation learning","Deep Neural Networks."],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper491/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"A method for learning better representations, that acts as a regularizer and despite its no significant additional computation cost , achieves improvements over strong baselines on Supervised and Semi-supervised Learning tasks.","pdf":"/pdf/1d359c956a24a95b60f90b7abaaeaf39f0ad4793.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|manifold_mixup_learning_better_representations_by_interpolating_hidden_states","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019manifold,    \ntitle={Manifold Mixup: Learning Better Representations by Interpolating Hidden States},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=rJlRKjActQ},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"B1e0KsRcYQ","original":"Skx4wSo9t7","number":492,"cdate":1538087813817,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087813817,"tmdate":1538156157782,"tddate":null,"forum":"B1e0KsRcYQ","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Efficient Codebook and Factorization for Second Order Representation Learning","abstract":"Learning rich and compact representations is an open topic in many fields such as word embedding, visual question-answering, object recognition or image retrieval. Although deep neural networks (convolutional or not) have made a major breakthrough during the last few years by providing hierarchical, semantic and abstract representations for all of these tasks, these representations are not necessary as rich as needed nor as compact as expected. Models using higher order statistics, such as bilinear pooling, provide richer representations at the cost of higher dimensional features. Factorization schemes have been proposed but without being able to reach the original compactness of first order models, or at a heavy loss in performances. This paper addresses these two points by extending factorization schemes to codebook strategies, allowing compact representations with the same dimensionality as first order representations, but with second order performances. Moreover, we extend this framework with a joint codebook and factorization scheme, granting a reduction both in terms of parameters and computation cost.

Consequently, model size reduction has become an utmost goal in deep learning. A typical approach is to train a set of deterministic weights, while applying certain techniques such as pruning and quantization, in order that the empirical weight distribution becomes amenable to Shannon-style coding schemes. However, as shown in this paper, relaxing weight determinism and using a full variational distribution over weights allows for more efficient coding schemes and consequently higher compression rates. In particular, following the classical bits-back argument, we encode the network weights using a random sample, requiring only a number of bits corresponding to the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the sampled variational distribution and the encoding distribution. By imposing a constraint on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, we are able to explicitly control the compression rate, while optimizing the expected loss on the training set. The employed encoding scheme can be shown to be close to the optimal information-theoretical lower bound, with respect to the employed variational family.

Most existing RL algorithms estimate value function based on this temporal decomposition.\n\nIn our formulation, value function $Q(s,a)$ is a weight sum of reward $R(s')$, and the weight is the discounted visiting frequency $d(s, a, s')$. Here $d(s, a, s')$ is the key part that captures long-term dependency between current state/action with future state. This formulation inspires us to study $d(s, a, s')$ in depth, with function approximation as usual.\nUnder the function approximation setting, $d(s, a, s')$ enjoys the benefit of generalization between similar state $s'$. Due to this generalization property, we can get better estimation for $d(s, a, s')$, thus resulting in a better estimation for $Q(s,a)$.

Our experiments, on various datasets, demonstrate that PATE-GAN consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art method with respect to this and other notions of synthetic data quality.","keywords":["Synthetic data generation","Differential privacy","Generative adversarial networks","Private Aggregation of Teacher ensembles"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper498/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"pdf":"/pdf/e7b0c524efd14960bf4563219e564080769dddab.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|pategan_generating_synthetic_data_with_differential_privacy_guarantees","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019pate-gan:,    \ntitle={PATE-GAN: Generating Synthetic Data with Differential Privacy Guarantees},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=S1zk9iRqF7},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"rkMk9j0qYm","original":"rJx9p4qqKm","number":499,"cdate":1538087815137,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087815137,"tmdate":1538156156333,"tddate":null,"forum":"rkMk9j0qYm","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Explainable Adversarial Learning: Implicit Generative Modeling of Random Noise during Training for Adversarial Robustness","abstract":"We introduce Explainable Adversarial Learning, ExL, an approach for training neural networks that are intrinsically robust to adversarial attacks.

However, because of the large architecture search spaces and the high computational cost associated with evaluating each candidate model, further gains in computational efficiency are needed.  Here we present a method termed Teacher Guided Search for Architectures by Generation and Evaluation (TG-SAGE) that produces up to an order of magnitude in search efficiency over PGAS methods. Specifically, TG-SAGE guides each step of the architecture search by evaluating the similarity of internal representations of the candidate networks with those of the (fixed) teacher network. We show that this procedure leads to significant reduction in required per-sample training and that, this advantage holds for two different search spaces of architectures, and two different search algorithms. We further show that in the space of convolutional cells for visual categorization, TG-SAGE finds a cell structure with similar performance as was previously found using other methods but at a total computational cost that is two orders of magnitude lower than Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and more than four times lower than progressive neural architecture search (PNAS). These results suggest that TG-SAGE can be used to accelerate network architecture search in cases where one has access to some or all of the internal representations of a teacher network of interest, such as the brain.

We propose a remarkably simple alternative based on off-policy reinforcement learning, which rewards the agent for matching demonstrated actions in demonstrated states — the key idea is initially filling the agent's experience replay buffer with demonstrations where rewards are set to a positive constant, and setting rewards to zero in all additional experiences. We derive this RL algorithm from first principles as a method for performing approximate inference under the MaxCausalEnt model of expert behavior — the approximate inference objective trades off between a pure behavioral cloning loss and a regularization term that incorporates information about state transitions via the soft Bellman error.

Acoustic modeling is the fundamental part of speech recognition and is usually implemented with long short-term memory (LSTM)-based recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, the single thread execution of an LSTM RNN is extremely slow in most embedded devices because the algorithm needs to fetch a large number of parameters from the DRAM for computing each output sample. We explore a few acoustic modeling algorithms that can be executed very efficiently on embedded devices. These algorithms reduce the overhead of memory accesses using multi-timestep parallelization that computes multiple output samples at a time by reading the parameters only once from the DRAM. The algorithms considered are the quasi RNNs (QRNNs), Gated ConvNets, and diagonalized LSTMs. In addition, we explore neural networks that equip one-dimensional (1-D) convolution at each layer of these algorithms, and by which can obtain a very large performance increase in the QRNNs and Gated ConvNets. The experiments were conducted using two tasks, one is the connectionist temporal classification (CTC)-based end-to-end speech recognition on WSJ corpus and the other is the phoneme classification on TIMIT dataset. We not only significantly increase the execution speed but also obtain a much higher accuracy, compared to LSTM RNN-based modeling.

For various generator classes such as mixture of Gaussians, exponential families, and invertible and injective neural networks generators, we design corresponding discriminators (which are often neural nets of specific architectures) such that the Integral Probability Metric (IPM) induced by the discriminators can provably approximate the Wasserstein distance and/or KL-divergence. This implies that if the training is successful, then the learned distribution is close to the true distribution in Wasserstein distance or KL divergence, and thus cannot drop modes.

To date, evidence of this phenomenon has been indirect and aroused controversy due to theoretical and practical complications. In particular, it has been pointed out that the MI with the input is theoretically inﬁnite in many cases of interest, and that the MI with the target is fundamentally difﬁcult to estimate in high dimensions. As a consequence, the validity of this theory has been questioned. In this paper, we overcome these obstacles by two means. First, as previously suggested, we replace the MI with the input by a noise-regularized version, which ensures it is ﬁnite. As we show, this modiﬁed penalty in fact acts as a form of weight decay regularization. Second, to obtain accurate (noise regularized) MI estimates between an intermediate representation and the input, we incorporate the strong prior-knowledge we have about their relation, into the recently proposed MI estimator of Belghazi et al. (2018). With this scheme, we are able to stably train each layer independently to explicitly optimize the IB functional. Surprisingly, this leads to enhanced prediction accuracy, thus directly validating the IB theory of deep nets for the ﬁrst time.","keywords":[],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper511/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"pdf":"/pdf/cd16d24a97cdf99a42891e90fef94d552f63c38e.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|the_effectiveness_of_layerbylayer_training_using_the_information_bottleneck_principle","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019the,    \ntitle={The effectiveness of layer-by-layer training using the information bottleneck principle},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=r1Nb5i05tX},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"B1VZqjAcYX","original":"S1lk-PFqKm","number":512,"cdate":1538087817475,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087817475,"tmdate":1538156153637,"tddate":null,"forum":"B1VZqjAcYX","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"SNIP: SINGLE-SHOT NETWORK PRUNING BASED ON CONNECTION SENSITIVITY","abstract":"Pruning large neural networks while maintaining the performance is often highly desirable due to the reduced space and time complexity.

One way to address this question is to find an upper bound on the probability (equivalently a lower bound on the negative log likelihood) that the model can assign to some data as one varies the prior and/or the likelihood function in a latent variable model. The core of our contribution is to formally show that the problem of optimizing priors in latent variable models is exactly an instance of the variational optimization problem that information theorists solve when computing rate-distortion functions, and then to use this to derive a lower bound on negative log likelihood. Moreover, we will show that if changing the prior can improve the log likelihood, then there is a way to change the likelihood function instead and attain the same log likelihood, and thus rate-distortion theory is of relevance to both optimizing priors as well as optimizing likelihood functions. We will experimentally argue for the usefulness of quantities derived from rate-distortion theory in latent variable modeling by applying them to a problem in image modeling.","keywords":["latent variable modeling","rate-distortion theory","log likelihood bounds"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper522/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"Use rate-distortion theory to bound how much a latent variable model can be improved","pdf":"/pdf/c967ba5a1f2293b66ddee7de3daad8d94a5ec056.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|information_theoretic_lower_bounds_on_negative_log_likelihood","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019information,    \ntitle={Information Theoretic lower bounds on negative log likelihood},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=rkemqsC9Fm},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"H1xmqiAqFm","original":"rklknVc5KX","number":523,"cdate":1538087819488,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087819488,"tmdate":1538156151349,"tddate":null,"forum":"H1xmqiAqFm","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Investigating CNNs' Learning Representation under label noise","abstract":"Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are known to be robust against label noise on extensive datasets.

Much of researches focusing on such memorization uses class-irrelevant label noise to simulate label corruption, but this setting is simple and unrealistic. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of CNNs under realistically simulated label noise, which is generated based on the conceptual distance between classes of a large dataset (i.e., ImageNet-1k).

However, there is still a lack of understanding on how and why SGD can train these complex networks towards a global minimum. In this study, we establish the convergence of SGD to a global minimum for nonconvex optimization problems that are commonly encountered in neural network training. Our argument exploits the following two important properties: 1) the training loss can achieve zero value (approximately), which has been widely observed in deep learning; 2) SGD follows a star-convex path, which is verified by various experiments in this paper.  In such a context, our analysis shows that SGD, although has long been considered as a randomized algorithm, converges in an intrinsically deterministic manner to a global minimum.

One way to accelerate the coordination effect is to enable multiple agents to communicate with each other in a distributed manner and behave as a group. In this paper, we study a practical scenario when (i) the communication bandwidth is limited and (ii) the agents share the communication medium so that only a restricted number of agents are able to simultaneously use the medium, as in the state-of-the-art wireless networking standards. This calls for a certain form of communication scheduling. In that regard, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework, called SchedNet, in which agents learn how to schedule themselves, how to encode the messages, and how to select actions based on received messages. SchedNet is capable of deciding which agents should be entitled to broadcasting their (encoded) messages, by learning the importance of each agent’s partially observed information. We evaluate SchedNet against multiple baselines under two different applications, namely, cooperative communication and navigation, and predator-prey.

When the complexity of data is comparable to the model expression power in the sense that training and test data share similar phase transitions in normalized margin dynamics, two efficient ways are derived via classic margin-based generalization bounds to successfully predict the trend of generalization error.

In this paper, we propose to optimize for a joint generative-discriminative objective across multimodal data and labels. We introduce a model that factorizes representations into two sets of independent factors: multimodal discriminative and modality-specific generative factors. Multimodal discriminative factors are shared across all modalities and contain joint multimodal features required for discriminative tasks such as sentiment prediction. Modality-specific generative factors are unique for each modality and contain the information required for generating data. Experimental results show that our model is able to learn meaningful multimodal representations that achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance on six multimodal datasets.

However, due to the easily corrupted EEG signals and also non-smooth RTs during data collection, regular regression methods generally suffer from poor generalization performance.  Considering that human response time is the reflection of brain dynamics preference rather than a single value, a novel model called Brain Dynamic ranking (BDrank) has been proposed. BDrank could learn from brain dynamics preferences using EEG data robustly and preserve the ordering corresponding to RTs. BDrank model is based on the regularized alternative ordinal classification comparing to regular regression based practices. Furthermore, a transition matrix is introduced to characterize the reliability of each channel used in EEG data, which helps in learning brain dynamics preferences only from informative EEG channels. In order to handle large-scale EEG signals~and obtain higher generalization, an online-generalized Expectation Maximum (OnlineGEM) algorithm also has been proposed to update BDrank in an online fashion. Comprehensive empirical analysis on EEG signals from 44 participants shows that BDrank together with OnlineGEM achieves substantial improvements in reliability while simultaneously detecting possible less informative and noisy EEG channels.","keywords":["mental fatigue","brain dynamics preference","brain dynamics ranking","channel reliability","channel Selection"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper559/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"pdf":"/pdf/9e31f37d81afabbe95666b63b1e598e46cf9cee2.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|mental_fatigue_monitoring_using_brain_dynamics_preferences","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019mental,    \ntitle={Mental Fatigue Monitoring using Brain Dynamics Preferences},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=B1l9qsA5KQ},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"B1e9csRcFm","original":"B1esvZ2ctQ","number":560,"cdate":1538087826383,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087826383,"tmdate":1538156143462,"tddate":null,"forum":"B1e9csRcFm","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"The Importance of Norm Regularization in Linear Graph Embedding: Theoretical Analysis and Empirical Demonstration","abstract":"Learning distributed representations for nodes in graphs is a crucial primitive in network analysis with a wide spectrum of applications.

Both theoretical and empirical evidence are provided to support this argument: (a) we prove that the generalization error of these methods can be bounded by limiting the norm of vectors, regardless of the embedding dimension; (b) we show that the generalization performance of linear graph embedding methods is correlated with the norm of embedding vectors, which is small due to the early stopping of SGD and the vanishing gradients.

Since human cognition is not optimized to work well in high-dimensional spaces, these areas could benefit from interpretable low-dimensional representations. However, most representation learning algorithms for time series data are difficult to interpret. This is due to non-intuitive mappings from data features to salient properties of the representation and non-smoothness over time.\nTo address this problem, we propose a new representation learning framework building on ideas from interpretable discrete dimensionality reduction and deep generative modeling. This framework allows us to learn discrete representations of time series, which give rise to smooth and interpretable embeddings with superior clustering performance. We introduce a new way to overcome the non-differentiability in discrete representation learning and present a gradient-based version of the traditional self-organizing map algorithm that is more performant than the original. Furthermore, to allow for a probabilistic interpretation of our method, we integrate a Markov model in the representation space.\nThis model uncovers the temporal transition structure, improves clustering performance even further and provides additional explanatory insights as well as a natural representation of uncertainty.\nWe evaluate our model in terms of clustering performance and interpretability on static (Fashion-)MNIST data, a time series of linearly interpolated (Fashion-)MNIST images, a chaotic Lorenz attractor system with two macro states, as well as on a challenging real world medical time series application on the eICU data set.

To address this issue, we propose a repulsive loss function to actively learn the difference among the real data by simply rearranging the terms in MMD. Second, inspired by the hinge loss, we propose a bounded Gaussian kernel to stabilize the training of MMD-GAN.

On the other hand, this rigorous mathematical framework allows us to learn precise, compact information and be able to coherently propagate measures of uncertainty across spatio-temporal states. To efficiently and rigorously process high-dimensional data coming from complex systems, we advocate for an information theory inspired approach that incorporates stochastic calculus and seeks to determine a trade-off between the predictive accuracy and compactness of the mathematical representation. Mathematically, such a model construction is cast as an optimization problem that maximizes the compression such that the predictive ability and correlation (relatedness) constraints between the original data and compact model are closely bounded. To learn this compact representation of a time-varying complex system and solve the above-mentioned optimization problem we use variational calculus and derive its general solution expressions. Moreover, we provide theoretical guarantees concerning the convergence of the proposed algorithm. To further test the proposed framework, we consider a high-dimensional Gaussian case study and describe an iterative scheme for updating the new model parameters. Using numerical experiments, we demonstrate the benefits on compression and prediction accuracy for a class of dynamical systems.

In spite of the advance, clustering with representation learning has been limited to flat-level categories, which oftentimes involves cohesive clustering with a focus on instance relations. To overcome the limitations of flat clustering, we introduce hierarchically clustered representation learning (HCRL), which simultaneously optimizes representation learning and hierarchical clustering in the embedding space. Specifically, we place a nonparametric Bayesian prior on embeddings to handle dynamic mixture hierarchies under the variational autoencoder framework, and to adopt the generative process of a hierarchical-versioned Gaussian mixture model. Compared with a few prior works focusing on unifying representation learning and hierarchical clustering, HCRL is the first model to consider a generation of deep embeddings from every component of the hierarchy, not just leaf components.

Such great success is mainly due to special structure design to fit the particular data patterns, such as CNN capturing spatial locality and RNN modeling sequential dependency. Essentially, these specific NNs achieve good performance by leveraging the prior knowledge over corresponding domain data. Nevertheless, there are many applications with all kinds of tabular data in other domains. Since there are no shared patterns among these diverse tabular data, it is hard to design specific structures to fit them all. Without careful architecture design based on domain knowledge, it is quite challenging for NN to reach satisfactory performance in these tabular data domains. To fill the gap of NN in tabular data learning, we propose a universal neural network solution, called TabNN, to derive effective NN architectures for tabular data in all kinds of tasks automatically. Specifically, the design of TabNN follows two principles: \\emph{to explicitly leverages expressive feature combinations} and \\emph{to reduce model complexity}. Since GBDT has empirically proven its strength in modeling tabular data, we use GBDT to power the implementation of TabNN. Comprehensive experimental analysis on a variety of tabular datasets demonstrate that TabNN can achieve much better performance than many baseline solutions.","keywords":["neural network","machine learning","tabular data"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper585/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"We propose a universal neural network solution to derive effective NN architectures for tabular data automatically.","pdf":"/pdf/a34f2a5fe5011db3059293570c340e5d8066fd00.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|tabnn_a_universal_neural_network_solution_for_tabular_data","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019tabnn:,    \ntitle={TabNN: A Universal Neural Network Solution for Tabular Data},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=r1eJssCqY7},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"B1fysiAqK7","original":"ryglwI2cFm","number":586,"cdate":1538087830997,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087830997,"tmdate":1538156138028,"tddate":null,"forum":"B1fysiAqK7","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Probabilistic Binary Neural Networks","abstract":"Low bit-width weights and activations are an effective way of combating the increasing need for both memory and compute power of Deep Neural Networks.

In our paper, we shed some lights on the practicality and hardness of adversarial training by first showing that the effectiveness of adversarial training procedure on test set has a strong correlation with the distance between the test point and the manifold of training data. The test examples that are relatively far away from the distribution of training dataset are more likely to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. Consequentially, adversarial training based defense is susceptible to a new class of attacks (“blind-spot attack”) where the input image resides in a “blind-spot” in the empirical distribution of training data but is still on the ground-truth data manifold. For MNIST, we found that these blind-spots can be easily found by simply scaling and shifting image pixel values. Most importantly, for large datasets with high dimensional and complex data manifold (CIFAR, ImageNet, etc), the existence of blind-spots in adversarial training makes the defense on any valid test examples almost impossible due to the curse of dimensionality.","keywords":["Adversarial Examples","Adversarial Training","Blind-Spot Attack"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1584/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":" We show that the effectiveness of adversarial training procedure on test set has a strong correlation with the distance between the test point and the manifold of training data.","pdf":"/pdf/dbf39ee0dbdc55c7eb50fa903193136f1ce98dec.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|the_limitations_of_adversarial_training_and_the_blindspot_attack","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019the,    \ntitle={The Limitations of Adversarial Training and the Blind-Spot Attack},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=HylTBhA5tQ},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"B1gTShAct7","original":"HJlhT3T5K7","number":1583,"cdate":1538088004639,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538088004639,"tmdate":1538156133696,"tddate":null,"forum":"B1gTShAct7","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Learning to Learn without Forgetting By Maximizing Transfer and Minimizing Interference","abstract":"Lack of performance when it comes to continual learning over non-stationary distributions of data remains a major challenge in scaling neural network learning to more human realistic settings.

For all the six state-of-the-art pruning algorithms we examined, fine-tuning a pruned model only gives comparable or even worse performance than training that model with randomly initialized weights. For pruning algorithms which assume a predefined architecture of the target pruned network, one can completely get rid of the pipeline and directly train the target network from scratch.

The cause of this problem is that we can not obtain training data of the unseen class and that the representation of attributes is poor. To solve this, we propose a concept to learn a mapping that embeds both images and attributes to a space that is robust to such representations and generalized even for unseen data, which we refer to shared manifold learning.

This paper tries to answer the question: under a black-box setting, can we create adversarial examples automatically to effectively fool deep learning classifiers on texts by making imperceptible changes? Our answer is a firm yes. Previous efforts mostly replied on using gradient evidence, and they are less effective either due to finding the nearest neighbor word (wrt meaning) automatically is difficult or relying heavily on hand-crafted linguistic rules. We, instead, use Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) for finding the most important few words to perturb and perform homoglyph attack by replacing one character in each selected word with a symbol of identical shape.  Our novel algorithm, we call MCTSBug, is black-box and extremely effective at the same time. Our experimental results indicate that MCTSBug can fool deep learning classifiers at the success rates of 95% on seven large-scale benchmark datasets, by perturbing only a few characters.  Surprisingly, MCTSBug, without relying on gradient information at all, is more effective than the gradient-based white-box baseline. Thanks to the nature of homoglyph attack, the generated adversarial perturbations are almost imperceptible to human eyes.

Some state-of-the-art approaches train an encoder-decoder network on paired text and audio samples (x_txt, x_aud) by encouraging its output to reconstruct x_aud. The synthesized audio waveform is expected to contain the verbal content of x_txt and the auditory style of x_aud. Unfortunately, modeling style in TTS is somewhat under-determined and training models with a reconstruction loss alone is insufficient to disentangle content and style from other factors of variation. In this work, we introduce TTS-GAN, an end-to-end TTS model that offers enhanced content-style disentanglement ability and controllability. We achieve this by combining a pairwise training procedure, an adversarial game, and a collaborative game into one training scheme. The adversarial game concentrates the true data distribution, and the collaborative game minimizes the distance between real samples and generated samples in both the original space and the latent space. As a result, TTS-GAN delivers a highly controllable generator, and a disentangled representation. Benefiting from the separate modeling of style and content, TTS-GAN can generate human fidelity speech that satisfies the desired style conditions.

We conduct human studies to show that our optimized adversarial 3D perturbation is highly unnoticeable for human vision systems. In addition to the subtle perturbation on a given 3D mesh, we also propose to synthesize a realistic 3D mesh to put in a scene mimicking similar rendering conditions and therefore attack existing objects within it.

The encapsulated 3D-Conv makes local perceptrons of RNNs motion aware and enables the memory cell to store better short-term features. For long-term relations, we make the present memory state interact with its historical records via a gate-controlled self-attention module. We describe this memory transition mechanism eidetic as it is able to effectively recall the stored memories across multiple timestamps even after long periods of disturbance. We first evaluate the spatiotemporal modeling capability of the E3D-LSTM model on two widely-used future video prediction datasets and achieve the state of the art performance.

Modeling the combinatorial label interactions in MLC has been along-haul challenge. Recurrent neural network (RNN) based encoder-decoder models have recently shown state-of-the-art performance for solving MLC. However,the sequential nature of modeling label dependencies through an RNN limits its ability in parallel computation, predicting dense labels, and providing interpretable results. In this paper, we propose Graph2Graph Networks, graph neural network models aiming to provide fast, accurate, and interpretable MLC. Graph2Graph networks replace all RNNs in the encoder-decoder architecture with graph attention mechanisms and dispense with autoregressive inference entirely. Our Graph2Graph decoder for MLC uses a modified graph attention network on an unknown and conditional graph to estimate how the labels and label interactions attend to the components of an input. Similarly, the Graph2Graph encoder adapts another graph attention network to learn representations about inputs via an unknown graph. This enables it to freely model interactions among input components and is not limited to sequential inputs. The proposed models are simple, fast, accurate, interpretable,and structure-agnostic (as long as input and output structures can each be described as graphs). Experiments on six real-world MLC datasets show the proposed models outperform autoregressive RNN models across five different metrics with a significant speedup during training and testing time.","keywords":["Multi-label Classification","Graph Neural Networks","Attention","Graph Attention"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1560/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"We propose Graph2Graph networks for a fast and accurate way of modelling label dependencies for multi-label classification.","pdf":"/pdf/b3f60bef04d5cd00be194a51adc9a243cddc0979.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|graph2graph_networks_for_multilabel_classification","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019graph2graph,    \ntitle={Graph2Graph Networks for Multi-Label Classification},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=r1xYr3C5t7},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"rkgKBhA5Y7","original":"HklMVx0cYQ","number":1559,"cdate":1538088000531,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538088000531,"tmdate":1538156128710,"tddate":null,"forum":"rkgKBhA5Y7","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"There Are Many Consistent Explanations of Unlabeled Data: Why You Should Average","abstract":"Presently the most successful approaches to semi-supervised learning are based on consistency regularization, whereby a model is trained to be robust to small perturbations of its inputs and parameters.

We also propose fast-SWA, which further accelerates convergence by averaging multiple points within each cycle of a cyclical learning rate schedule. With weight averaging, we achieve the best known semi-supervised results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 over many different settings of training labels.

However, training data may be available in a related language.  We introduce a cross-lingual document classification framework CACO between related language pairs.  To best use limited training data, our transfer learning scheme exploits cross-lingual subword similarity by jointly training a character-based embedder and a word-based classifier.  The embedder derives vector representations for input words from their written forms, and the classifier makes predictions based on the word vectors.

However, most advancements have been made in static graph settings while efforts for jointly learning dynamic of the graph and dynamic on the graph are still in an infant stage. Two fundamental questions arise in learning over dynamic graphs: (i) How to elegantly model dynamical processes over graphs? (ii) How to leverage such a model to effectively encode evolving graph information into low-dimensional representations? We present DyRep - a novel modeling framework for dynamic graphs that posits representation learning as a latent mediation process bridging two observed processes namely -- dynamics of the network (realized as topological evolution) and dynamics on the network (realized as activities between nodes). Concretely, we propose a two-time scale deep temporal point process model that captures the interleaved dynamics of the observed processes. This model is further parameterized by a temporal-attentive representation network that encodes temporally evolving structural information into node representations which in turn drives the nonlinear evolution of the observed graph dynamics. Our unified framework has inductive capability to generalize over unseen nodes and we design an efficient unsupervised procedure for end-to-end training. We demonstrate that DyRep outperforms state-of-art baselines in quantitative analysis using dynamic link prediction and time prediction tasks. We further present extensive qualitative insights into our framework to discern indispensable role of various components of our framework.","keywords":["Dynamic Graphs","Representation Learning","Dynamic Processes","Temporal Point Process","Attention","Latent Representation"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1553/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"Models Representation Learning over dynamic graphs as latent hidden process bridging two observed processes of Topological Evolution of and Interactions on dynamic graphs.","pdf":"/pdf/776adcd06cd6fec3352526d59a1426e4a9984335.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|dyrep_learning_representations_over_dynamic_graphs","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019dyrep:,    \ntitle={DyReP: Learning Representations over Dynamic Graphs},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=HyePrhR5KX},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"rkxwShA9Ym","original":"ryxWcmhqKQ","number":1552,"cdate":1538087999341,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087999341,"tmdate":1538156127249,"tddate":null,"forum":"rkxwShA9Ym","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Label super-resolution networks","abstract":"We present a deep learning-based method for super-resolving coarse (low-resolution) labels assigned to groups of image pixels into pixel-level (high-resolution) labels, given the joint distribution between those low- and high-resolution labels.

These results are in contrast to experience with Euclidean data, where it is difficult to form a generative scattering network that performs as well as state-of-the-art methods.

This suggests that self-attention might also be well-suited to modeling music. In musical composition and performance, however, relative timing is critically important.  Existing approaches for representing relative positional information in the Transformer modulate attention based on pairwise distance (Shaw et al., 2018).  This is impractical for long sequences such as musical compositions since their memory complexity is quadratic in the sequence length.  We propose an algorithm that reduces the intermediate memory requirements to linear in the sequence length. This enables us to demonstrate that a Transformer with our modified relative attention mechanism can generate minute-long (thousands of steps) compositions with compelling structure, generate continuations that coherently elaborate on a given motif, and in a seq2seq setup generate accompaniments conditioned on melodies.

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on both generic and domain-specific synonym datasets: Wiki+Freebase, PubMed+UMLS and MedBook+MKG, with up to 4.16% improvement in terms of Area Under the Curve (AUC) and 3.19% in terms of Mean Average Precision (MAP) compare to the best baseline method.","keywords":["deep learning","entity synonym"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1530/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"We introduce SynonymNet, a deep model for entity synonym discovery by a bilateral matching among multiple pieces of contexts in which an entity is mentioned.","pdf":"/pdf/e979fbc526e254c52c01bbebb0db64aba3dd02ef.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|synonymnet_multicontext_bilateral_matching_for_entity_synonyms","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019synonymnet:,    \ntitle={SynonymNet: Multi-context Bilateral Matching for Entity Synonyms},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=H1f7S3C9YQ},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"r1MmH30cY7","original":"rJx5fJ_cY7","number":1529,"cdate":1538087995320,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087995320,"tmdate":1538156122422,"tddate":null,"forum":"r1MmH30cY7","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Confidence Regularized Self-Training","abstract":"Recent advances in domain adaptation show that self-training with deep networks presents a powerful means for unsupervised domain adaptation. Specifically, these methods often involve an iterative process of predicting on target domain and then taking the confident predictions as pseudo-labels for retraining. Basic self-training treats selected pseudo-labels equally as one-hot vectors, and the selection process is often modeled to be progressive via self-paced learning. While one-hot vector is a natural choice to model multiclass targets, such encoding scheme does not consider the difference between selected samples. As a result, the approach sometimes generates overconfident false pseudo-labels that lead to the convergence to deviated solutions with propagated errors, especially when there is a large domain gap. To address this problem, we generalize self-training as an expectation maximization (EM) problem which treats pseudo-labels as latent variables, and solves maximum marginal likelihood estimation (MMLE) by maximizing its lower bound. We then propose confidence regularized self-training, where we introduce multiple confidence regularizers along with their solutions. These regularizers mainly consider the control of pseudo-label confidence from two aspects: model regularization and label refinement. Experiments on both semantic segmentation and image classification show that self-training with different confidence regularizers comprehensively outperform their non-regularized counterparts.","keywords":["Neural network","domain adaptation","self-training","maximum marginal likelihood estimation","Expectation-Maximization","regularization"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1529/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"A self-training optimization framework with pseudo-label confidence regularization ","pdf":"/pdf/ba0dc0e19b927f76c30b17006b2eedd7ff57cd37.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|confidence_regularized_selftraining","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019confidence,    \ntitle={Confidence Regularized Self-Training},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=r1MmH30cY7},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"HylXHhA9Km","original":"H1eY2SC5Y7","number":1528,"cdate":1538087995145,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087995145,"tmdate":1538156122219,"tddate":null,"forum":"HylXHhA9Km","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Statistical Characterization of Deep Neural Networks and their Sensitivity","abstract":"Despite their ubiquity, it remains an active area of research to fully understand deep neural networks (DNNs) and the reasons of their empirical success.

This cost contains two terms: a policy cost which represents the objective the policy seeks to optimize, and an uncertainty cost which represents its divergence from the states it is trained on. We propose to measure this second cost by using the uncertainty of the dynamics model about its own predictions, using recent ideas from uncertainty estimation for deep networks.

In this paper, we introduce a novel softmax layer approximation algorithm by exploiting the clustering structure of context vectors. Our algorithm uses a light-weight screening model to predict a much smaller set of candidate words based on the given context, and then conducts an exact softmax only within that subset. Training such a procedure end-to-end is challenging as traditional clustering methods are discrete and non-differentiable, and thus unable to be used with back-propagation in the training process. Using the Gumbel softmax, we are able to train the screening model end-to-end on the training set to exploit data distribution. The algorithm achieves an order of magnitude faster inference than the original softmax layer for predicting top-k words in various tasks such as beam search in machine translation or next words prediction. For example, for machine translation task on German to English dataset with around 25K vocabulary, we can achieve 20.4 times speed up with 98.9% precision@1 and 99.3% precision@5 with the original softmax layer prediction, while state-of-the-art (Zhang et al., 2018) only achieves 6.7x speedup with 98.7% precision@1 and 98.1% precision@5 for the same task.","keywords":["fast inference","softmax computation","natural language processing"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1524/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"pdf":"/pdf/ecb895abf7d8c58f71c0ca99dee71111c02bf73f.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|learning_to_screen_for_fast_softmax_inference_on_large_vocabulary_neural_networks","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019learning,    \ntitle={Learning to Screen for Fast Softmax  Inference on Large Vocabulary Neural Networks},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=ByeMB3Act7},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"r1efr3C9Ym","original":"S1gVkB6qF7","number":1523,"cdate":1538087994285,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087994285,"tmdate":1538156121215,"tddate":null,"forum":"r1efr3C9Ym","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Interpolation-Prediction Networks for Irregularly Sampled Time Series","abstract":"In this paper, we present a new deep learning architecture for addressing the problem of supervised learning with sparse and irregularly sampled multivariate time series.

Automatic robot design has been a long studied subject but with limited success due to the large combinatorial search space and the difficulty in evaluating the found solution. In this paper, We propose Neural Graph Evolution (NGE) to address these two challenges. We formulate automatic robot design as a graph search problem and perform evolution search in graph space. NGE uses graph neural networks to parameterize the control polices that allows skill transfer from previously evaluated control policy to a new robot design. The policy sharing and transfer greatly reducing the cost of re-training new candidates. Similar to ES, NGE performs selection on current candidates and evolves new ones iteratively. In addition, NGE applies Graph Mutation by incorporating model uncertainty, which reduces the search space by balancing exploration and exploitation.

We find that learning a sparse representation is more beneficial for\nsequential learning than encouraging parameter sparsity. In particular, we propose a novel regularizer, that encourages representation sparsity by means of neural inhibition. It results in few active neurons which in turn leaves more free neurons to be utilized by upcoming tasks. As suppressing all other neurons in a layer can be too drastic, especially for complex tasks requiring strong representations, our regularizer only inhibits other neurons in a local neighborhood, inspired by inhibition processes in the brain.

In this paper, we propose to learn a particle-based simulator for complex control tasks. Combining learning with particle-based systems brings in two major benefits: first, the learned simulator, just like other particle-based systems, acts widely on objects of different materials; second, the particle-based representation poses strong inductive bias for learning: particles of the same type have the same dynamics within. This enables the model to quickly adapt to new environments of unknown dynamics within a few observations. Using the learned simulator, robots have achieved success in complex manipulation tasks, such as manipulating fluids and deformable foam.

However, state-of-the-art imitation learning algorithms often assume the optimality of the given demonstration set.\nIn this paper, we address such optimal assumption by learning only from the most suitable demonstrations in a given set. Suitability of a demonstration is estimated by whether imitating it produce desirable outcomes for achieving the goals of the tasks. For more efficient demonstration suitability assessments, the learning agent should be capable of imitating a demonstration as quick as possible, which shares similar spirit with fast adaptation in the meta-learning regime.

We observe that although intuitively the confidence that a convolutional neural network (CNN) has that an image belongs to a particular class could serve as outlierness measure to each image, directly applying this confidence to detect outlier does not work well. This is because CNN often has high confidence on an outlier image that does not belong to any target class due to its generalization ability that ensures the high accuracy in classification. To solve this issue, we propose a Deep Neural Forest-based approach that harmonizes the contradictory requirements of accurately classifying images and correctly detecting the outlier images. Our experiments using several benchmark image datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN demonstrate the effectiveness of our IOD approach for outlier detection, capturing more than 90% of outliers generated by injecting one image dataset into another, while still preserving the classification accuracy of the multi-class classification problem.","keywords":["Image outlier","CNN","Deep Neural Forest"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1492/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"A novel approach that detects outliers from image data,  while at the same time preserving the classification accuracy of the multi-class classification problem","pdf":"/pdf/3ae3145edf80407dbbe8b60292004d6514c400f1.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|outlier_detection_from_image_data","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019outlier,    \ntitle={Outlier Detection from Image Data},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=HygTE309t7},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"r1laEnA5Ym","original":"rJlqs7_vFX","number":1491,"cdate":1538087988778,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087988778,"tmdate":1538156114468,"tddate":null,"forum":"r1laEnA5Ym","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"A Variational Inequality Perspective on Generative Adversarial Networks","abstract":"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) form a generative modeling approach known for producing appealing samples, but they are notably difficult to train.

This phenomenon, referred to as catastrophic forgetting, is considered a major hurdle to learning with non-stationary data or sequences of new tasks, and prevents networks from continually accumulating knowledge and skills. We examine this issue in the context of reinforcement learning, in a setting where an agent is exposed to tasks in a sequence. Unlike most other work, we do not provide an explicit indication to the model of task boundaries, which is the most general circumstance for a learning agent exposed to continuous experience. While various methods to counteract catastrophic forgetting have recently been proposed, we explore a straightforward, general, and seemingly overlooked solution - that of using experience replay buffers for all past events - with a mixture of on- and off-policy learning, leveraging behavioral cloning. We show that this strategy can still learn new tasks quickly yet can substantially reduce catastrophic forgetting in both Atari and DMLab domains, even matching the performance of methods that require task identities.

With experiments on CelebA, 3DChairs, and dSprites datasets, we demonstrate that the visual quality of samples generated by IB-GAN is often better than those by β-VAEs. Moreover, IB-GAN achieves much higher disentanglement metrics score than β-VAEs or InfoGAN on the dSprites dataset.","keywords":["Unsupervised disentangled representation learning","GAN","Information Bottleneck","Variational Inference"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1480/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"Inspired by Information Bottleneck theory,  we propose a new architecture of GAN for a disentangled representation learning","pdf":"/pdf/b105db21f43332bf06385a059e8c0ef7a0e2992e.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|ibgan_disentangled_representation_learning_with_information_bottleneck_gan","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019ib-gan:,    \ntitle={IB-GAN: Disentangled Representation Learning with Information Bottleneck GAN},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=ryljV2A5KX},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"rkxoNnC5FQ","original":"S1eTjcitt7","number":1479,"cdate":1538087986661,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087986661,"tmdate":1538156111954,"tddate":null,"forum":"rkxoNnC5FQ","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"SPIGAN: Privileged Adversarial Learning from Simulation","abstract":"Deep Learning for Computer Vision depends mainly on the source of supervision.Photo-realistic simulators can generate large-scale automatically labeled syntheticdata, but introduce a domain gap negatively impacting performance.

Compared to the well-studied many-class many-shot and few-class few-shot problems, MCFS problem commonly occurs in practical applications but is rarely studied. MCFS brings new challenges because it needs to distinguish between many classes, but only a few samples per class are available for training. In this paper, we propose ``memory-augmented hierarchical-classification network (MahiNet)'' for MCFS learning. It addresses the ``many-class'' problem by exploring the class hierarchy, e.g., the coarse-class label that covers a subset of fine classes, which helps to narrow down the candidates for the fine class and is cheaper to obtain. MahiNet uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features, and integrates a memory-augmented attention module with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to produce the probabilities over coarse and fine classes. While the MLP extends the linear classifier, the attention module extends a KNN classifier, both together targeting the ``few-shot'' problem. We design different training strategies of MahiNet for supervised learning and meta-learning. Moreover, we propose two novel benchmark datasets ''mcfsImageNet'' (as a subset of ImageNet) and ''mcfsOmniglot'' (re-splitted Omniglot) specifically for MCFS problem.

Supervised parsers have traditionally been used to obtain these trees, but lately interest has increased in unsupervised methods that induce syntactic representations directly from unlabeled text. To this end, we propose the deep inside-outside recursive autoencoder (DIORA), a fully-unsupervised method for discovering syntax that simultaneously learns representations for constituents within the induced tree. Unlike many prior approaches, DIORA does not rely on supervision from auxiliary downstream tasks and is thus not constrained to particular domains. Furthermore, competing approaches do not learn explicit phrase representations along with tree structures, which limits their applicability to phrase-based tasks.

For example, there is still a lack of theories of convergence for SGD and its variants that use stagewise step size and return an averaged solution in practice. In addition, theoretical insights of why adaptive step size of AdaGrad could improve non-adaptive step size of SGD is still missing for non-convex optimization.   This paper aims to address these questions and fill the gap between theory and practice. We propose a universal stagewise optimization framework for a broad family of non-smooth non-convex problems with the following key features: (i) at each stage any suitable stochastic convex optimization algorithms (e.g., SGD  or AdaGrad)  that return an averaged solution can be employed for minimizing a regularized convex problem; (ii) the step size is decreased in  a stagewise manner; (iii)  an averaged solution  is returned as the final solution. % that is selected from all stagewise averaged solutions with sampling probabilities  increasing as the stage number. \nOur theoretical results of stagewise {\\ada}  exhibit its adaptive convergence, therefore shed insights on its faster convergence than stagewise SGD  for problems with slowly growing cumulative stochastic gradients.

A plethora of work has demonstrated that it is easy to find or synthesize inputs for which a neural network is highly confident yet wrong. Generative models are generally viewed to be robust to such overconfidence mistakes as modeling the density of the input features can be used to detect novel,  out-of-distribution inputs. \nIn this paper we challenge this assumption, focusing our analysis on flow-based generative models in particular since they are trained and evaluated via the exact marginal likelihood. We find that the model density cannot distinguish images of common objects such as dogs, trucks, and horses (i.e. CIFAR-10) from those of house numbers (i.e. SVHN), assigning a higher likelihood to the latter when the model is trained on the former.  We find such behavior persists even when we restrict the flow models to constant-volume transformations.  These admit some theoretical analysis, and we show that the difference in likelihoods can be explained by the location and variances of the data and the model curvature, which shows that such behavior is more general and not just restricted to the pairs of datasets used in our experiments. Our results suggest caution when using density estimates of deep generative models on out-of-distribution inputs.

Graph-based Semi Supervised Learning (SSL) methods aim to address this problem by labeling a small subset of the nodes as seeds, and then utilizing the graph structure to predict label scores for the rest of the nodes in the graph. Recently, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have achieved impressive performance on the graph-based SSL task. In addition to label scores, it is also desirable to have a confidence score associated with them. Unfortunately, confidence estimation in the context of GCN has not been previously explored. We fill this important gap in this paper and propose ConfGCN, which estimates labels scores along with their confidences jointly in GCN-based setting.

This is in sharp contrast to human and animal learning: humans and animals can use past experience to acquire an understanding about the world, which they can then use to perform new tasks with minimal additional learning. In this work, we study how an unsupervised exploration phase can be used to build up such prior knowledge, which can then be utilized in a second phase to perform new tasks, either directly without any additional exploration, or through minimal fine-tuning. A critical question with this approach is: what kind of knowledge should be transferred from the unsupervised phase to the goal-directed phase? We argue that model-based RL offers an appealing solution. By transferring models, which are task-agnostic, we can perform new tasks without any additional learning at all. However, this relies on having a suitable exploration method during unsupervised training, and a model-based RL method that can effectively utilize modern high-capacity parametric function classes, such as deep neural networks. We show that both challenges can be addressed by representing model-uncertainty, which can both guide exploration in the unsupervised phase and ensure that the errors in the model are not exploited by the planner in the goal-directed phase. We illustrate, on simple simulated benchmark tasks, that our method can perform various goal-directed skills on the first attempt, and can improve further with fine-tuning, exceeding the performance of alternative exploration methods.","keywords":["exploration","model based reinforcement learning"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1451/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"pdf":"/pdf/175cb1413aa109f9ab1332986c8926a2441b1541.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|unsupervised_exploration_with_deep_modelbased_reinforcement_learning","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019unsupervised,    \ntitle={Unsupervised Exploration with Deep Model-Based Reinforcement Learning},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=B1xU4nAqK7},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"BJ4BVhRcYX","original":"ryxWWNRctm","number":1450,"cdate":1538087981470,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087981470,"tmdate":1538156105842,"tddate":null,"forum":"BJ4BVhRcYX","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"INTERPRETABLE CONVOLUTIONAL FILTER PRUNING","abstract":"The sophisticated structure of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) allows for\noutstanding performance, but at the cost of intensive computation.

However, both modes of task specification have their disadvantages: reward functions require manual engineering, while demonstrations require a human expert to be able to actually perform the task in order to generate the demonstration. Instruction following from natural language instructions provides an appealing alternative: in the same way that we can specify goals to other humans simply by speaking or writing, we would like to be able to specify tasks for our machines. However, a single instruction may be insufficient to fully communicate our intent or, even if it is, may be insufficient for an autonomous agent to actually understand how to perform the desired task. In this work, we propose an interactive formulation of the task specification problem, where iterative language corrections are provided to an autonomous agent, guiding it in acquiring the desired skill. Our proposed language-guided policy learning algorithm can integrate an instruction and a sequence of corrections to acquire new skills very quickly.

In this work we use imitation learning to address two of these challenges:  how to learn a useful representation of the world e.g.  from pixels, and how to explore efficiently given the rarity of a reward signal? We show that adversarial imitation can work well even in this high dimensional observation space. Surprisingly the adversary itself, acting as the learned reward function, can be tiny, comprising as few as 128 parameters, and can be easily trained using the most basic GAN formulation. Our approach removes limitations present in most contemporary imitation approaches: requiring no demonstrator actions (only video), no special initial conditions or warm starts, and no explicit tracking of any single demo. The proposed agent can solve a challenging robot manipulation task of block stacking from only video demonstrations and sparse reward, in which the non-imitating agents fail to learn completely.  Furthermore, our agent learns much faster than competing approaches that depend on hand-crafted, staged dense reward functions, and also better compared to standard GAIL baselines. Finally, we develop a new adversarial goal recognizer that in some cases allows the agent to learn stacking without any task reward, purely from imitation.","keywords":["imitation","from pixels","adversarial"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1444/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"Imitation from pixels, with sparse or no reward, using off-policy RL and a tiny adversarially-learned reward function.","pdf":"/pdf/d2433f5e54c14a167852d8a7ac32028e53de92d0.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|visual_imitation_with_a_minimal_adversary","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019visual,    \ntitle={Visual Imitation with a Minimal Adversary},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=rygVV205KQ},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"S1xNEhR9KX","original":"r1xarz05Y7","number":1443,"cdate":1538087980268,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087980268,"tmdate":1538156104327,"tddate":null,"forum":"S1xNEhR9KX","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"On the Sensitivity of Adversarial Robustness to Input Data Distributions","abstract":"Neural networks are vulnerable to small adversarial perturbations. Existing literature largely focused on understanding and mitigating the vulnerability of learned models. In this paper, we demonstrate an intriguing phenomenon about adversarial training, arguably the most popular robust training method in the literature: Adversarial robustness, unlike clean accuracy, is sensitive to the input data distribution. Even a semantics-preserving transformations on the input data distribution can cause a significantly different robustness for the adversarial trained model that is both trained and evaluated on the new distribution. Our discovery of such sensitivity on data distribution is based on a study which disentangles the behaviors of clean accuracy and robust accuracy of the Bayes classifier. Further empirical investigation on MNIST and CIFAR10 confirms our finding that numerous MNIST and CIFAR10 variants achieve comparable clean accuracies in various different neural nets under standard training but significantly different robustness under adversarial training. This counter-intuitive phenomenon indicates that input data distribution alone can affect the adversarial robustness of trained neural networks, not necessarily the tasks themselves. Lastly, we discuss the practical implications on evaluating adversarial robustness, and make initial attempts to understand this complex phenomenon.\n","keywords":["adversarial robustness","PGD training","adversarial perturbation","input data distribution"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper1443/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"Robustness performance of PGD trained models are sensitive to semantics-preserving transformation of image datasets, which implies the trickiness of evaluation of robust learning algorithms in practice.","pdf":"/pdf/409a181f2b7a07a6b16333977b6a9c3d0be78545.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|on_the_sensitivity_of_adversarial_robustness_to_input_data_distributions","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019on,    \ntitle={On the Sensitivity of Adversarial Robustness to Input Data Distributions},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=S1xNEhR9KX},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"ByME42AqK7","original":"S1xC3liqFQ","number":1442,"cdate":1538087980100,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087980100,"tmdate":1538156104108,"tddate":null,"forum":"ByME42AqK7","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Efficient Multi-Objective Neural Architecture Search via Lamarckian Evolution","abstract":"Architecture search aims at automatically finding neural architectures that are competitive with architectures designed by human experts.

Model compression (also known as distillation) is a technique to compress a complex model into a simpler one while maintaining most of the original accuracy. This can be done by using the same dataset for both the model training and compression tasks or by exploiting additional data. However, in many real-world applications, additional data are not available, and the repeated use of the original training data leads to suboptimal compression. In this work, we propose to use generative adversarial networks (GANs) to approximately sample from the distribution of the original data, thus generating ''unlimited'' synthetic data that can be used to perform the compression task. Our GAN-assisted model compression approach shows significant improvement in compressing complex models such as deep neural networks and large random forests on both image and tabular datasets. Furthermore, based on the model compression results, we propose a comprehensive metric—the Compression Score—to evaluate the quality of generative models, which captures both the discriminability and the diversity of the synthetic data. We show that the Compression Score performs well in cases when the popular Inception Score fails.

Conventional algorithms like stochastic gradient descent optimize the neural networks in the vector space of weights, which is, however, not positively scale-invariant. This mismatch may lead to problems during the optimization process. Then, a natural question is: \\emph{can we construct a new vector space that is positively scale-invariant and sufficient to represent ReLU neural networks so as to better facilitate the optimization process }? In this paper, we provide our positive answer to this question. First, we conduct a formal study on the positive scaling operators which forms a transformation group, denoted as $\\mathcal{G}$. We prove that the value of a path (i.e. the product of the weights along the path) in the neural network is invariant to positive scaling and the value vector of all the paths is sufficient to represent the neural networks under mild conditions. Second, we show that one can identify some basis paths out of all the paths and prove that the linear span of their value vectors (denoted as $\\mathcal{G}$-space) is an invariant space with lower dimension under the positive scaling group. Finally, we design stochastic gradient descent algorithm in $\\mathcal{G}$-space (abbreviated as $\\mathcal{G}$-SGD) to optimize the value vector of the basis paths of neural networks with little extra cost by leveraging back-propagation. Our experiments show that $\\mathcal{G}$-SGD significantly outperforms the conventional SGD algorithm in optimizing ReLU networks on benchmark datasets.

Specifically, we consider a 3D first-person task where agents must navigate procedurally generated mazes, and where RL agents have recently achieved human-level average-case performance.

A very natural approach is to prune connections of DNNs via $\\ell_1$ regularization, but recent empirical investigations have suggested that this does not work as well in the context of DNN compression. In this work, we revisit this simple strategy and analyze it rigorously, to show that: (a) any \\emph{stationary point} of an $\\ell_1$-regularized layerwise-pruning objective has its number of non-zero elements bounded by the number of penalized prediction logits, regardless of the strength of the regularization; (b) successful pruning highly relies on an accurate optimization solver, and there is a trade-off between compression speed and distortion of prediction accuracy, controlled by the strength of regularization. Our theoretical results thus suggest that $\\ell_1$ pruning could be successful provided we use an accurate optimization solver.

In contrast, networks with non-saturating activation functions achieved comparable levels of task performance but did not show compression.

Short term memory plays an integral role in aggregating the information obtained from these glimpses and informing our interpretation of the scene. Computational models have attempted to address glimpsing and visual attention but have failed to incorporate the notion of memory. We introduce a novel, biologically inspired visual working memory architecture that we term the Hebb-Rosenblatt memory. We subsequently introduce a fully differentiable Short Term Attentive Working Memory model (STAWM) which uses transformational attention to learn a memory over each image it sees. The state of our Hebb-Rosenblatt memory is embedded in STAWM as the weights space of a layer. By projecting different queries through this layer we can obtain goal-oriented latent representations for tasks including classification and visual reconstruction. Our model obtains highly competitive classification performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10. As demonstrated through the CelebA dataset, to perform reconstruction the model learns to make a sequence of updates to a canvas which constitute a parts-based representation. Classification with the self supervised representation obtained from MNIST is shown to be in line with the state of the art models (none of which use a visual attention mechanism). Finally, we show that STAWM can be trained under the dual constraints of classification and reconstruction to provide an interpretable visual sketchpad which helps open the `black-box' of deep learning.","keywords":["memory","visual attention","image classification","image reconstruction","latent representations"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper598/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"A biologically inspired working memory that can be integrated in recurrent visual attention models for state of the art performance","pdf":"/pdf/3e9a1d743a78dbce20c1829e9125e94c2c034a43.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|a_biologically_inspired_visual_working_memory_for_deep_networks","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019a,    \ntitle={A Biologically Inspired Visual Working Memory for Deep Networks},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=B1fbosCcYm},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"S1VWjiRcKX","original":"SyglADn9tQ","number":599,"cdate":1538087833304,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087833304,"tmdate":1538156096448,"tddate":null,"forum":"S1VWjiRcKX","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Universal Successor Features Approximators","abstract":"The ability of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to learn about many reward functions at the same time has many potential benefits, such as the decomposition of complex tasks into simpler ones, the exchange of information between tasks, and the reuse of skills.

Another way to generalise to new tasks is to exploit structure in the RL problem itself.

The absence of any framework to analyze the precision requirements of partial sum accumulations results in conservative design choices. This imposes an upper-bound on the reduction of complexity of multiply-accumulate units. We present a statistical approach to analyze the impact of reduced accumulation precision on deep learning training. Observing that a bad choice for accumulation precision results in loss of information that manifests itself as a reduction in variance in an ensemble of partial sums, we derive a set of equations that relate this variance to the length of accumulation and the minimum number of bits needed for accumulation. We apply our analysis to three benchmark networks: CIFAR-10 ResNet 32, ImageNet ResNet 18 and ImageNet AlexNet. In each case, with accumulation precision set in accordance with our proposed equations, the networks successfully converge to the single precision floating-point baseline. We also show that reducing accumulation precision further degrades the quality of the trained network, proving that our equations produce tight bounds.

But the increased memory footprint of these models presents a challenge during training, when all intermediate layer activations need to be stored for back-propagation. Limited GPU memory forces practitioners to make sub-optimal choices: either train inefficiently with smaller batches of examples; or limit the architecture to have lower depth and width, and fewer layers at higher spatial resolutions. This work introduces an approximation strategy that significantly reduces a network's memory footprint during training, but has negligible effect on training performance and computational expense. During the forward pass, we replace activations with lower-precision approximations immediately after they have been used by subsequent layers, thus freeing up memory. The approximate activations are then used during the backward pass. This approach limits the accumulation of errors across the forward and backward pass---because the forward computation across the network still happens at full precision, and the approximation has a limited effect when computing gradients to a layer's input. Experiments, on CIFAR and ImageNet, show that using our approach with 8- and even 4-bit fixed-point approximations of 32-bit floating-point activations has only a minor effect on training and validation performance, while affording significant savings in memory usage.","keywords":["Back-propagation","Memory Efficient Training","Approximate Gradients","Deep Learning"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper604/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"An algorithm to reduce the amount of memory required for training deep networks, based on an approximation strategy.","pdf":"/pdf/c87e6aa248b9dfed0b44a3d51f4f55125b5897fe.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|backprop_with_approximate_activations_for_memoryefficient_network_training","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019backprop,    \ntitle={Backprop with Approximate Activations for Memory-efficient Network Training},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=rJgfjjC9Ym},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"ryxMjoRcYm","original":"rkx8POn5tm","number":605,"cdate":1538087834372,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087834372,"tmdate":1538156095222,"tddate":null,"forum":"ryxMjoRcYm","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Logically-Constrained Neural Fitted Q-iteration","abstract":"This paper proposes a method for efficient training of the Q-function for continuous-state Markov Decision Processes (MDP), such that the traces of the resulting policies satisfy a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) property.

A novel indicator is derived to characterize the efficiency of escaping from minima through measuring the alignment of noise covariance and the curvature of loss function. Based on this indicator, two conditions are established to show which type of noise structure is superior to isotropic noise in term of escaping efficiency.

This problem becomes more evident in tasks where the information needed to correctly solve them exist over long time scales, because EVGP prevents important gradient components from being back-propagated adequately over a large number of steps. We introduce a simple stochastic algorithm h-detach that is specific to LSTM optimization and targeted towards addressing this problem. Specifically, we show that when the LSTM weights are large, the gradient components through the linear path (cell state) in the LSTM computational graph get suppressed.

In this paper, we will introduce a new representation learning model, namely “Sample-Ensemble Genetic Evolutionary Network” (SEGEN), which can serve as an alternative approach to deep learning models. Instead of building one single deep model, based on a set of sampled sub-instances, SEGEN adopts a genetic-evolutionary learning strategy to build a group of unit models generations by generations. The unit models incorporated in SEGEN can be either traditional machine learning models or the recent deep learning models with a much “narrower” and “shallower” architecture. The learning results of each instance at the final generation will be effectively combined from each unit model via diffusive propagation and ensemble learning strategies. From the computational perspective, SEGEN requires far less data, fewer computational resources and parameter tuning efforts, but has sound theoretic interpretability of the learning process and results. Extensive experiments have been done on several different real-world benchmark datasets, and the experimental results obtained by SEGEN have demonstrated its advantages over the state-of-the-art representation learning models.","keywords":["Genetic Evolutionary Network","Deep Learning","Genetic Algorithm","Ensemble Learning","Representation Learning"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper613/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"We introduce a new representation learning model, namely “Sample-Ensemble Genetic Evolutionary Network” (SEGEN), which can serve as an alternative approach to deep learning models.","pdf":"/pdf/72acae32af5730c669efa51298f7d276b3dbc41f.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|segen_sampleensemble_genetic_evolutionary_network_model","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019segen:,    \ntitle={SEGEN: SAMPLE-ENSEMBLE GENETIC EVOLUTIONARY NETWORK MODEL},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=HJgVisRqtX},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"BJgEjiRqYX","original":"SkeW1cicKm","number":614,"cdate":1538087835981,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087835981,"tmdate":1538156093339,"tddate":null,"forum":"BJgEjiRqYX","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"A Case for Object Compositionality in Deep Generative Models of Images","abstract":"Deep generative models seek to recover the process with which the observed data was generated.

This provides a way to efficiently learn a more accurate generative model of real-world images, and serves as an initial step towards learning corresponding object representations.

A number of post-training model compression techniques, such as distillation, pruning and quantization, can reduce the size of network parameters by a substantial fraction with little loss in performance. However, training a small network of the post-compression size de novo typically fails to reach the same level of accuracy achieved by compression of a large network, leading to a widely-held belief that gross overparameterization is essential to effective learning. In this work, we argue that this is not necessarily true.  We describe a dynamic sparse reparameterization technique that closed the performance gap between a model compressed by pruning and a model of the post-compression size trained de novo. We applied our method to training deep residual networks and showed that it outperformed existing static reparameterization techniques, yielding the best accuracy for a given parameter budget for training. Compared to other dynamic reparameterization methods that reallocate non-zero parameters during training, our approach broke free from a few key limitations and achieved much better performance at lower computational cost.

By necessity, most theoretical guarantees revolve around convex-concave (or even linear) problems; however, making theoretical inroads towards efficient GAN training depends crucially on moving beyond this classic framework. To make piecemeal progress along these lines, we analyze the behavior of mirror descent (MD) in a class of non-monotone problems whose solutions coincide with those of a naturally associated variational inequality – a property which we call coherence. We first show that ordinary, “vanilla” MD converges under a strict version of this condition, but not otherwise; in particular, it may fail to converge even in bilinear models with a unique solution. We then show that this deficiency is mitigated by optimism: by taking an “extra-gradient” step, optimistic mirror descent (OMD) converges in all coherent problems. Our analysis generalizes and extends the results of Daskalakis et al. [2018] for optimistic gradient descent (OGD) in bilinear problems, and makes concrete headway for provable convergence beyond convex-concave games.

Implanting a backdoor watermark module into a neural network is getting more attention from the community. In this paper, we present a general purpose encoder-decoder joint training method, inspired by generative adversarial networks (GANs). Unlike GANs, however, our encoder and decoder neural networks cooperate to find the best watermarking scheme given data samples. In other words, we do not design any new watermarking strategy but our proposed two neural networks will find the best suited method on their own. After being trained, the decoder can be implanted into other neural networks to attack or protect them (see Appendix for their use cases and real implementations). To this end, the decoder should be very tiny in order not to incur any overhead when attached to other neural networks but at the same time provide very high decoding success rates, which is very challenging. Our joint training method successfully solves the problem and in our experiments maintain almost 100\\% encoding-decoding success rates for multiple datasets with very little modifications on data samples to hide watermarks.

In this work, we propose instead to directly target a later desired task by meta-learning an unsupervised learning rule, which leads to representations useful for that task. Here, our desired task (meta-objective) is the performance of the representation on semi-supervised classification, and we meta-learn an algorithm -- an unsupervised weight update rule -- that produces representations that perform well under this meta-objective.  Additionally, we constrain our unsupervised update rule to a be a biologically-motivated, neuron-local function, which enables it to generalize to novel neural network architectures. We show that the meta-learned update rule produces useful features and sometimes outperforms existing unsupervised learning techniques.

The theory suggests that DNN training comprises a rapid fitting phase followed by a slower compression phase, in which the mutual information I(X;T) between the input X and internal representations T decreases. Several papers observe compression of estimated mutual information on different DNN models, but the true I(X;T) over these networks is provably either constant (discrete X) or infinite (continuous X). This work explains the discrepancy between theory and experiments, and clarifies what was actually measured by these past works. To this end, we introduce an auxiliary (noisy) DNN framework for which I(X;T) is a meaningful quantity that depends on the network's parameters. This noisy framework is shown to be a good proxy for the original (deterministic) DNN both in terms of performance and the learned representations. We then develop a rigorous estimator for I(X;T) in noisy DNNs and observe compression in various models. By relating I(X;T) in the noisy DNN to an information-theoretic communication problem, we show that compression is driven by the progressive clustering of hidden representations of inputs from the same class. Several methods to directly monitor clustering of hidden representations, both in noisy and deterministic DNNs, are used to show that meaningful clusters form in the T space. Finally, we return to the estimator of I(X;T) employed in past works, and demonstrate that while it fails to capture the true (vacuous) mutual information, it does serve as a measure for clustering. This clarifies the past observations of compression and isolates the geometric clustering of hidden representations as the true phenomenon of interest.","keywords":["information theory","representation learning","deep learning","differential entropy estimation"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper636/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"Deterministic deep neural networks do not discard information, but they do cluster their inputs.","pdf":"/pdf/b464fe0c5a7dc9708734452dcd4e16e8a479cd48.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|estimating_information_flow_in_dnns","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019estimating,    \ntitle={Estimating Information Flow in DNNs},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=HkxOoiAcYX},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"SyfdsjA9FX","original":"S1lxkb8qFQ","number":637,"cdate":1538087840280,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087840280,"tmdate":1538156088485,"tddate":null,"forum":"SyfdsjA9FX","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Live Face De-Identification in Video","abstract":"We propose a method for face de-identification that enables fully automatic video modification at high frame rates.

In this paper, we propose a theoretically motivated framework that dynamically weights the importance of actions by using the mutual-information. In particular, we express the RL problem as an inference problem where the prior probability distribution over actions is subject to optimization. We show that the prior optimization introduces a mutual-information regularizer in the RL objective. This regularizer encourages the policy to be close to a non-uniform distribution that assigns higher probability mass to more important actions.

Experiments on language modeling and machine translation show that our method can largely mitigate the representation degeneration problem and achieve better performance than baseline algorithms.","keywords":["Natural Language Processing","Representation Learning"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper644/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"pdf":"/pdf/b0b8331bd8c900388c553e3f69a2dcc9e43d2ea8.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|representation_degeneration_problem_in_training_natural_language_generation_models","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019representation,    \ntitle={Representation Degeneration Problem in Training Natural Language Generation Models},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=SkEYojRqtm},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"rkxciiC9tm","original":"ryg-tz6wtX","number":645,"cdate":1538087841680,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087841680,"tmdate":1538156086809,"tddate":null,"forum":"rkxciiC9tm","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"NADPEx: An on-policy temporally consistent exploration method for deep reinforcement learning","abstract":"Reinforcement learning agents need exploratory behaviors to escape from local optima. These behaviors may include both immediate dithering perturbation and temporally consistent exploration. To achieve these, a stochastic policy model that is inherently consistent through a period of time is in desire, especially for tasks with either sparse rewards or long term information. In this work, we introduce a novel on-policy temporally consistent exploration strategy - Neural Adaptive Dropout Policy Exploration (NADPEx) - for deep reinforcement learning agents. Modeled as a global random variable for conditional distribution, dropout is incorporated to reinforcement learning policies, equipping them with inherent temporal consistency, even when the reward signals are sparse. Two factors, gradients' alignment with the objective and KL constraint in policy space, are discussed to guarantee NADPEx policy's stable improvement. Our experiments demonstrate that NADPEx solves tasks with sparse reward while naive exploration and parameter noise fail. It yields as well or even faster convergence in the standard mujoco benchmark for continuous control.

We explore a particularly simple algorithm for robust, communication-efficient learning---signSGD. Workers transmit only the sign of their gradient vector to a server, and the overall update is decided by a majority vote. This algorithm uses 32x less communication per iteration than full-precision, distributed SGD.

We model adversaries as those workers who may compute a stochastic gradient estimate and manipulate it, but may not coordinate with other adversaries. Aggregating sign gradients by majority vote means that no individual worker has too much power. We prove that unlike SGD, majority vote is robust when up to 50% of workers behave adversarially.

However, these representations are hard to interpret. For example, visualizing a latent layer is generally only possible for at most three dimensions. Neural networks are able to learn and benefit from much higher dimensional representations but these are not visually interpretable because nodes have arbitrary ordering within a layer. Here, we utilize the ability of the human observer to identify patterns in structured representations to visualize higher dimensions. To do so, we propose a class of regularizations we call \\textit{Graph Spectral Regularizations} that impose graph-structure on latent layers. This is achieved by treating activations as signals on a predefined graph and constraining those activations using graph filters, such as low pass and wavelet-like filters. This framework allows for any kind of graph as well as filter to achieve a wide range of structured regularizations depending on the inference needs of the data. First, we show a synthetic example that the graph-structured layer can reveal topological features of the data. Next, we show that a smoothing regularization can impose semantically consistent ordering of nodes when applied to capsule nets. Further, we show that the graph-structured layer, using wavelet-like spatially localized filters, can form localized receptive fields for improved image and biomedical data interpretation. In other words, the mapping between latent layer, neurons and the output space becomes clear due to the localization of the activations. Finally, we show that when structured as a grid, the representations create coherent images that allow for image-processing techniques such as convolutions.","keywords":["autoencoder","interpretable","graph signal processing","graph spectrum","graph filter","capsule"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper659/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"Imposing graph structure on neural network layers for improved visual interpretability.","pdf":"/pdf/23d53b1f9c8e989b383cce7c6a9eff44a4f24c8d.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|graph_spectral_regularization_for_neural_network_interpretability","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019graph,    \ntitle={Graph Spectral Regularization For Neural Network Interpretability},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=B1lnjo05Km},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"SJe2so0qF7","original":"r1lngq5qK7","number":660,"cdate":1538087844393,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087844393,"tmdate":1538156083653,"tddate":null,"forum":"SJe2so0qF7","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Learning data-derived privacy preserving representations from information metrics","abstract":"It is clear that users should own and control their data and privacy. Utility providers are also becoming more interested in guaranteeing data privacy. Therefore, users and providers can and should collaborate in privacy protecting challenges, and this paper addresses this new paradigm. We propose a framework where the user controls what characteristics of the data they wants to share (utility) and what they want to keep private (secret), without necessarily asking the utility provider to change its existing machine learning algorithms. We first analyze the space of privacy-preserving representations, and derive natural information-theoretic bounds on the utility-privacy trade-off when disclosing a sanitized version of the data X. We present explicit architectures to learn privacy-preserving representations that approach this bound in a data-driven fashion. We then describe important use-case scenarios where the utility providers are willing to collaborate, at least partially, with the sanitization process. In this setting, we limit the possible sanitization functions to space-preserving transformations, meaning the sanitation maps the data to the same space as the original data, and the utility provider can then use the exact same (existing) algorithm for the original and sanitized data, a novel critical attribute to help service providers to collaborate. We illustrate this framework and show how we can maintain utility while protecting secret information even in cases where the joint distribution of the data X and the utility and secret variables U and S are unknown; and where the difficulty of inferring the utility variable U is much higher than the task of inferring the secret variable S. This is done through the implementation of three use cases; subject-within-subject, where we tackle the problem of having an identity detector (from facial images) that works only on a consenting subset of users, an important application, for example, for mobile devices activated by face recognition, helping them to become private to the environment instead of always ``listening as they currently act; gender-and-subject, where we want to preserve facial verification (hard) while hiding the gender attribute (easy) for users who choose to do so; and emotion-and-gender, where we tackle the issue of hiding independent variables, as is the case of hiding gender while preserving emotion detection.

More information that is relevant allows for better decisions but it may be costly to acquire all of this information.  How can we trade off the desire to make good decisions with the option to acquire further information at a cost? To this end, we propose a principled framework, named EDDI (Efficient Dynamic Discovery of high-value Information), based on the theory of Bayesian experimental design. In EDDI we propose a novel partial variational autoencoder (Partial VAE), to efficiently handle missing data over varying subsets of known information. EDDI combines this Partial VAE with an acquisition function that maximizes expected information gain on a set of target variables. EDDI is efficient and demonstrates that dynamic discovery of high-value information is possible; we show cost reduction at the same decision quality and improved decision quality at the same cost in benchmarks and in two health-care applications..

One way for agents to cooperate effectively is to form a team, make a binding agreement on a joint plan, and execute it. However, when agents are self-interested, the gains from team formation must be allocated appropriately to incentivize agreement. Various approaches for multi-agent negotiation have been proposed, but typically only work for particular negotiation protocols. More general methods usually require human input or domain-specific data, and so do not scale. To address this, we propose a framework for training agents to negotiate and form teams using deep reinforcement learning. Importantly, our method makes no assumptions about the specific negotiation protocol, and is instead completely experience driven. We evaluate our approach on both non-spatial and spatially extended team-formation negotiation environments, demonstrating that our agents beat hand-crafted bots and reach negotiation outcomes consistent with fair solutions predicted by cooperative game theory. Additionally, we investigate how the physical location of agents influences negotiation outcomes.","keywords":["Reinforcement Learning","Negotiation","Team Formation","Cooperative Game Theory","Shapley Value"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper668/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"Reinforcement learning can be used to train agents to negotiate team formation across many negotiation protocols","pdf":"/pdf/345c9ba0a550c5b38a053a2963c78634b0e9a1d2.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|negotiating_team_formation_using_deep_reinforcement_learning","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019negotiating,    \ntitle={Negotiating Team Formation Using Deep Reinforcement Learning},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=HJG0ojCcFm},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"r1GAsjC5Fm","original":"S1xZjmxcY7","number":669,"cdate":1538087846103,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087846103,"tmdate":1538156081784,"tddate":null,"forum":"r1GAsjC5Fm","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Self-Aware Visual-Textual Co-Grounded Navigation Agent","abstract":"The Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task entails an agent following navigational instruction in photo-realistic unknown environments.

To test this hypothesis, we introduce Tensor Product Decomposition Networks (TPDNs), which use TPRs to approximate existing vector representations. We demonstrate using synthetic data that TPDNs can successfully approximate linear and tree-based RNN autoencoder representations; those representation exhibit highly interpretable compositional structure. We explore the settings that lead RNNs to induce such structure-sensitive representations. By contrast with these results, TPDN experiments with four standard sentence encoding models showed that those sentence encodings could be largely approximated using bag-of-words representations, with only marginal improvements from more sophisticated structures.

We propose a method for end-to-end training of a base neural network that integrates calls to existing black-box functions.

Using this ``Estimate and Replace'' paradigm, we train a neural network, end to end, to compute the input to black-box functionality while eliminating the need for intermediate labels.

Tensor methods have the potential to parametrize over-complete representations in a compact manner by leveraging this redundancy. In this paper, we propose fully parametrizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a single, low-rank tensor. Previous works on network tensorization haved focused on parametrizing individual layers (convolutional or fully connected) only, and perform the tensorization layer-by-layer disjointly. In contrast, we propose to jointly capture the full structure of a CNN by parametrizing it with a single, high-order tensor, the modes of which represent each of the architectural design parameters of the CNN (e.g. number of convolutional blocks, depth, number of stacks, input features, etc). This parametrization allows to regularize the whole network and drastically reduce the number of parameters by imposing a low-rank structure on that tensor.

However, learning to predict raw future observations, such as frames in a video, is exceedingly challenging—the ambiguous nature of the problem can cause a naively designed model to average together possible futures into a single, blurry prediction. Recently, this has been addressed by two distinct approaches: (a) latent variational variable models that explicitly model underlying stochasticity and (b) adversarially-trained models that aim to produce naturalistic images. However, a standard latent variable model can struggle to produce realistic results, and a standard adversarially-trained model underutilizes latent variables and fails to produce diverse predictions. We show that these distinct methods are in fact complementary. Combining the two produces predictions that look more realistic to human raters and better cover the range of possible futures.

Here, we study a particular class of multi-agent problems called intertemporal social dilemmas (ISDs), where the conflict between the individual and the group is particularly sharp.

Here, we combine these two observations in order to learn fine-grained correspondences between language and contextually relevant geometric properties of 3D objects. To do this, we employed an interactive communication task with human participants to construct a large dataset containing natural utterances referring to 3D objects from ShapeNet in a wide variety of contexts. Using this dataset, we developed neural listener and speaker models with strong capacity for generalization. By performing targeted lesions of visual and linguistic input, we discovered that the neural listener depends heavily on part-related words and associates these words correctly with the corresponding geometric properties of objects, suggesting that it has learned task-relevant structure linking the two input modalities.

In particular, we show that if the features of the training dataset lie in a low-dimensional affine subspace and the cross-entropy loss is minimized by using a gradient method, the margin between the training points and the decision boundary could be much smaller than the optimal value. This result is contrary to the conclusions of recent related works such as (Soudry et al., 2018), and we identify the reason for this contradiction. In order to improve the margin, we introduce differential training, which is a novel training paradigm that uses a loss function defined on pairs of points from each class.

Specifically, we design trunk branch and (non-)local mask branch in each (non-)local attention block. The trunk branch is used to extract hierarchical features. Local and non-local mask branches aim to adaptively rescale these hierarchical features with soft attentions. The local mask branch concentrates on more local structures with convolutional operations, while non-local attention considers more about long-range dependencies in the whole feature map.

Here we consider learning both an energy function and  an efficient approximate sampling mechanism for the corresponding distribution. Whereas the critic (or discriminator) in generative adversarial networks (GANs) learns to separate data and generator samples, introducing an entropy maximization regularizer on the generator can turn the interpretation of the critic into an energy function, which separates the training distribution from everything else, and thus can be used for tasks like anomaly or novelty detection. \n\nThis paper is motivated by the older idea of sampling in latent space rather than data space because running a Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) in latent space has been found to be easier and more efficient, and because a GAN-like generator can convert latent space samples to data space samples. For this purpose, we show how a Markov chain can be run in latent space whose samples can be mapped to data space, producing better samples. These samples are also used for the negative phase gradient required to estimate the log-likelihood gradient of the data space energy function. To maximize entropy at the output of the generator, we take advantage of recently introduced neural estimators of mutual information.

It is typically carried out through posterior sampling over the model parameters, which makes it computationally expensive. To overcome this limitation, we directly incorporate uncertainty over the value (Q) function. Further, we only introduce randomness in the last layer (i.e. the output layer) of the DQN and use independent Gaussian priors on the weights. This allows us to efficiently carry out Thompson sampling through Gaussian sampling and Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR), which has fast closed-form updates. The rest of the layers of the Q network are trained through back propagation, as in a standard DQN. We apply our method to a wide range of Atari games in Arcade Learning Environments and compare BDQN to a powerful baseline: the double deep Q-network (DDQN). Since BDQN carries out more efficient exploration, it is able to reach higher rewards substantially faster: in less than 5M±1M samples for almost half of the games to reach DDQN scores while a typical run of DDQN is 50-200M. We also establish theoretical guarantees for the special case when the feature representation is fixed and not learnt. We show that the Bayesian regret is bounded by O􏰒(d \\sqrt(N)) after N time steps for a d-dimensional feature map, and this bound is shown to be tight up-to logarithmic factors.

Thus in practice, IRL must commonly be performed with only a limited set of demonstrations where it can be exceedingly difficult to unambiguously recover a reward function.

Such bonus is summed up with the real task reward --- making it possible for RL algorithms to learn from the combined reward. We propose a new curiosity method which uses episodic memory to form the novelty bonus. To determine the bonus, the current observation is compared with the observations in memory. Crucially, the comparison is done based on how many environment steps it takes to reach the current observation from those in memory --- which incorporates rich information about environment dynamics. This allows us to overcome the known \"couch-potato\" issues of prior work --- when the agent finds a way to instantly gratify itself by exploiting actions which lead to unpredictable consequences. We test our approach in visually rich 3D environments in ViZDoom and DMLab. In ViZDoom, our agent learns to successfully navigate to a distant goal at least 2 times faster than the state-of-the-art curiosity method ICM.

Neural representations vary drastically across the first stages of visual processing. At the output of the retina, receptive fields (RFs) exhibit a clear antagonistic center-surround structure, whereas in the primary visual cortex (V1), typical RFs are sharply tuned to a precise orientation. Moreover, there are striking differences in early visual representations across species. Specifically, the retinas of small vertebrates (e.g. salamander, mouse) perform sophisticated non-linear computations extracting features directly relevant to behavior. In contrast, the dominant retinal cell types in primates encode the visual scene quasi-linearly and respond to a much broader range of stimuli. There is currently no theory explaining these differences in representation across layers and across species. Here, using a deep convolutional neural network trained on image recognition as a model of the visual system, we show that such differences in representation emerge as a direct consequence of different neural resource constraints on the retinal and brain networks. Whereas previous studies of efficient coding invoked inconsistent sets of metabolic constraints to account for the differences in RF shapes found in the retina and V1, we find a unique model from which both geometries spontaneously emerge at the appropriate stages of visual processing. The key constraint of this model is a reduced number of neurons at the retinal output, a constraint consistent with the anatomy of the optic nerve. Furthermore, we find that retinal neurons in our model emerge as non-linear and lossy feature detectors for small brain networks, whereas they emerge as linear and faithful encoders of the visual scene for large brains. Our results thus reconcile the two seemingly incompatible views of the retina as either performing feature extraction or efficient compression of natural scenes, by suggesting that all vertebrates lie on a spectrum between these two objectives, depending on the neural resources allocated to their visual system.","keywords":["visual system","convolutional neural networks","efficient coding","retina"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper734/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"We reproduced neural representations found in biological visual systems by simulating their neural resource constraints in a deep convolutional model.","pdf":"/pdf/4718f54b056a92b252b73db26e227c3af17737c0.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|the_effects_of_neural_resource_constraints_on_early_visual_representations","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019the,    \ntitle={The effects of neural resource constraints on early visual representations },    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=S1xq3oR5tQ},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"Byx93sC9tm","original":"BklfEractQ","number":735,"cdate":1538087857832,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087857832,"tmdate":1538156068022,"tddate":null,"forum":"Byx93sC9tm","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Deep Ensemble Bayesian Active Learning : Adressing the Mode Collapse issue in Monte Carlo dropout via Ensembles","abstract":"In image classification tasks, the ability of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to deal with complex image data has proved to be unrivalled.

We show that using various forms of fine-tuning, a common method for transfer learning, is not effective for adapting to such small visual changes. In fact, it is often easier to re-train the agent from scratch than to fine-tune a trained agent. We suggest that in some cases transfer learning can be improved by adding a dedicated component whose goal is to learn to visually map between the known domain and the new one. Concretely, we use Unaligned Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create a mapping function to translate images in the target task to corresponding images in the source task. These mapping functions allow us to transform between various variations of the Breakout game, as well as between different levels of a Nintendo game, Road Fighter. We show that learning this mapping is substantially more efficient than re-training.

We propose area attention: a way to attend to an area of the memory, where each area contains a group of items that are either spatially adjacent when the memory has a 2-dimensional structure, such as images, or temporally adjacent for 1-dimensional memory, such as natural language sentences. Importantly, the size of an area, i.e., the number of items in an area, can vary depending on the learned coherence of the adjacent items. Using an area of items, instead of a single, we hope attention mechanisms can better capture the nature of the task. Area attention can work along multi-head attention for attending multiple areas in the memory. We evaluate area attention on two tasks: character-level neural machine translation and image captioning, and improve upon strong (state-of-the-art) baselines in both cases. In addition to proposing the novel concept of area attention, we contribute an efficient way for computing it by leveraging the technique of summed area tables.","keywords":["Deep Learning","attentional mechanisms","machine translation","captioning"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper751/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"The paper presents a novel approach for attentional mechanisms that can benefit a range of tasks such as machine translation and image captioning.","pdf":"/pdf/9edb2cc9184edcd9f3d4da5aa47ff45d183b4738.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|area_attention","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019area,    \ntitle={Area Attention},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=rygp3iRcF7},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"SJx63jRqFm","original":"rJlS6znFYm","number":752,"cdate":1538087860766,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087860766,"tmdate":1538156064473,"tddate":null,"forum":"SJx63jRqFm","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Diversity is All You Need: Learning Skills without a Reward Function","abstract":"Intelligent creatures can explore their environments and learn useful skills without supervision.\nIn this paper, we propose ``Diversity is All You Need''(DIAYN), a method for learning useful skills without a reward function.

Files cannot be scanned indefinitely so the engine employs heuristics to determine when to halt execution. Previous research has investigated analyzing the sequence of system calls generated during this emulation process to predict if an unknown file is malicious, but these models require the emulation to be stopped after executing a fixed number of events from the beginning of the file. Also, these classifiers are not accurate enough to halt emulation in the middle of the file on their own. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm which overcomes this limitation and learns the best time to halt the file's execution based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Because the new DRL-based system continues to emulate the unknown file until it can make a confident decision to stop, it prevents attackers from avoiding detection by initiating malicious activity after a fixed number of system calls. Results show that the proposed malware execution control model automatically halts emulation for 91.3\\% of the files earlier than heuristics employed by the engine. Furthermore, classifying the files at that time improves the true positive rate by 61.5%, at a false positive rate of 1%, compared to a baseline classifier.","keywords":["malware","execution","control","deep reinforcement learning"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper756/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"TL;DR":"A deep reinforcement learning-based system is proposed to control when to halt the emulation of an unknown file and to improve the detection rate of a deep malware classifier.","pdf":"/pdf/76d48a687a17e35e453b3c635c407b84d2f35c44.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|neural_malware_control_with_deep_reinforcement_learning","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019neural,    \ntitle={NEURAL MALWARE CONTROL WITH DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=SJg6nj09F7},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"r1gR2sC9FX","original":"Byxz0brcFQ","number":757,"cdate":1538087861660,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087861660,"tmdate":1538156063417,"tddate":null,"forum":"r1gR2sC9FX","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"On the Spectral Bias of Neural Networks","abstract":"Prior work has theoretically established neural networks as a class of highly expressive functions.

As the multi-view data are usually complex in practice, nonlinear mappings are adopted to capture nonlinear dependency among the views. However, the interpretation provided in PCCA cannot be generalized to this nonlinear setting, as the distribution assumptions on the prior and the likelihood makes it restrictive to capture nonlinear dependency. To overcome this bottleneck, in this paper, we provide a novel perspective for CCA based on implicit distributions. Specifically, we present minimum Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) as a new criteria to capture nonlinear dependency for multi-view learning problem. To eliminate the explicit distribution requirement in direct estimation of CMI, we derive an objective whose minimization implicitly leads to the proposed criteria. Based on this objective, we present an implicit probabilistic formulation for CCA, named Implicit CCA (ICCA), which provides a flexible framework to design CCA extensions with implicit distributions.

For example, using the Randomized Gradient-Free method (Nesterov & Spokoiny, 2017), we are able to bound the number of iterations needed for our algorithm to achieve stationary points under mild assumptions. We demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the previous stochastic approaches to attacking convolutional neural networks on MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet datasets. More interestingly, we show that the proposed algorithm can also be used to attack other discrete and non-continuous machine learning models, such as Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT).","keywords":["Adversarial example","Hard-label","Black-box attack","Query-efficient"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper763/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"pdf":"/pdf/8e1aa47569975325dd4a7baa856c02050781a5d9.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|queryefficient_hardlabel_blackbox_attack_an_optimizationbased_approach","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019query-efficient,    \ntitle={Query-Efficient Hard-label Black-box Attack: An Optimization-based Approach},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=rJlk6iRqKX},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"rygypo0qtm","original":"Bke46Ip5tX","number":764,"cdate":1538087862865,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087862865,"tmdate":1538156061955,"tddate":null,"forum":"rygypo0qtm","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Show, Attend and Translate: Unsupervised Image Translation with Self-Regularization and Attention","abstract":"Image translation between two domains is a class of problems aiming to learn mapping from an input image in the source domain to an output image in the target domain. It has been applied to numerous applications, such as data augmentation, domain adaptation, and unsupervised training. When paired training data is not accessible, image translation becomes an ill-posed problem. We constrain the problem with the assumption that the translated image needs to be perceptually similar to the original image and also appears to be drawn from the new domain, and propose a simple yet effective image translation model consisting of a single generator trained with a self-regularization term and an adversarial term. We further notice that existing image translation techniques are agnostic to the subjects of interest and often introduce unwanted changes or artifacts to the input. Thus we propose to add an attention module to predict an attention map to guide the image translation process. The module learns to attend to key parts of the image while keeping everything else unaltered, essentially avoiding undesired artifacts or changes. The predicted attention map also opens door to applications such as unsupervised segmentation and saliency detection.

Bayesian neural networks have been proposed as a solution, but it remains open how to specify the prior. In particular, the common practice of a standard normal prior in weight space imposes only weak regularities, causing the function posterior to possibly generalize in unforeseen ways on out-of-distribution inputs. We propose noise contrastive priors (NCPs). The key idea is to train the model to output high uncertainty for data points outside of the training distribution. NCPs do so using an input prior, which adds noise to the inputs of the current mini batch, and an output prior, which is a wide distribution given these inputs. NCPs are compatible with any model that represents predictive uncertainty, are easy to scale, and yield reliable uncertainty estimates throughout training. Empirically, we show that NCPs prevent overfitting outside of the training distribution and result in uncertainty estimates that are useful for active learning.

We show deep networks are not only too sensitive to task-irrelevant changes of their input, as is well-known from epsilon-adversarial examples, but are also too invariant to a wide range of task-relevant changes, thus making vast regions in input space vulnerable to adversarial attacks.\nAfter identifying this excessive invariance, we propose the usage of bijective deep networks to enable access to all variations. We introduce metameric sampling as an analytic attack for these networks, requiring no optimization, and show that it uncovers large subspaces of misclassified inputs. Then we apply these networks to MNIST and ImageNet and show that one can manipulate the class-specific content of almost any image without changing the hidden activations. Further, we extend the standard cross-entropy loss to strengthen the model against such manipulations via an information-theoretic analysis, providing the first approach tailored explicitly to overcome invariance-based vulnerability.

Due to the unparallelizable nature of the autoregressive factorization, ART models have to generate tokens one by one during decoding and thus suffer from high inference latency. Recently, Non-AutoRegressive Translation (NART) models were proposed to reduce the inference time. However, they could only achieve inferior accuracy compared with ART models. To improve the accuracy of NART models, in this paper, we propose to leverage the hints from a well-trained ART model to train the NART model. We define two hints for the machine translation task: hints from hidden states and hints from word alignments, and use such hints to regularize the optimization of NART models. Experimental results show that the NART model trained with hints could achieve significantly better translation performance than previous NART models on several tasks. In particular, for the WMT14 En-De and De-En task, we obtain BLEU scores of 25.20 and 29.52 respectively, which largely outperforms the previous non-autoregressive baselines.

In the primary visual cortex of mammals, for example, one may observe during development the formation of cells selective to localized, oriented features. This leads to the development of a rough representation of contours of the retinal image in area V1. We modeled these mechanisms using sparse Hebbian learning algorithms. These algorithms alternate a coding step to encode the information with a learning step to find the proper encoder. A major difficulty faced by these algorithms is to deduce a good representation while knowing immature encoders, and to learn good encoders with a non-optimal representation. To address this problem, we propose here to introduce a new regulation process between learning and coding, called homeostasis. Our homeostasis is compatible with a neuro-mimetic architecture and allows for the fast emergence of localized filters sensitive to orientation. The key to this algorithm lies in a simple adaptation mechanism based on non-linear functions that reconciles the antagonistic processes that occur at the coding and learning time scales. We tested this unsupervised algorithm with this homeostasis rule for a range of existing unsupervised learning algorithms coupled with different neural coding algorithms. In addition, we propose a simplification of this optimal homeostasis rule by implementing a simple heuristic on the probability of activation of neurons. Compared to the optimal homeostasis rule, we show that this heuristic allows to implement a more rapid unsupervised learning algorithm while keeping a large part of its effectiveness.

Unlike existing works in the survival analysis on the basis of longitudinal data, the proposed method learns the time-to-event distributions without specifying underlying stochastic assumptions of the longitudinal or the time-to-event processes.

The current practice in neural network optimization is to rely on the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm or its adaptive variants. However, SGD requires a hand-designed schedule for the learning rate. In addition, its adaptive variants tend to produce solutions that generalize less well on unseen data than SGD with a hand-designed schedule. We present an optimization method that offers the best of both worlds: our algorithm yields good generalization performance while requiring only one hyper-parameter. Our approach is based on a composite proximal framework, which exploits the compositional nature of deep neural networks and can leverage powerful convex optimization algorithms by design. Specifically, we employ the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm for SVM, which computes an optimal step-size in closed-form at each time-step. We further show that the descent direction is given by a simple backward pass in the network, yielding the same computational cost per iteration as SGD. We customize the algorithm in two ways to further improve its performance. First, we use a descent direction that smoothes the loss function to better condition the problem. Second, we combine our proximal algorithm with Nesterov momentum to benefit from acceleration. We present experiments on the CIFAR and SNLI data sets, where we demonstrate the significant superiority of our method over Adam, Adagrad, as well as the recently proposed BPGrad and AMSGrad. Furthermore, we compare our algorithm to SGD with a hand-designed learning rate schedule, and show that it provides similar generalization while converging faster.","keywords":["optimization","conditional gradient","Frank-Wolfe"],"authorids":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/Paper807/Authors"],"authors":["Anonymous"],"pdf":"/pdf/3acce8fd45158372254aaf869b6b897346584553.pdf","paperhash":"anonymous|deep_frankwolfe_for_neural_network_optimization","_bibtex":"@inproceedings{    \nanonymous2019deep,    \ntitle={Deep Frank-Wolfe For Neural Network Optimization},    \nauthor={Anonymous},    \njournal={International Conference on Learning Representations},    \nyear={2019},    \nurl={https://openreview.net/forums?id=SyVU6s05K7},    \nnote={under review}    \n}"},"signatures":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"readers":["everyone"],"nonreaders":[],"writers":["ICLR.cc/2019/Conference"],"details":{"tags":[]}},{"id":"HkgDTiCctQ","original":"ryg37biqKQ","number":808,"cdate":1538087870524,"ddate":null,"tcdate":1538087870524,"tmdate":1538156052692,"tddate":null,"forum":"HkgDTiCctQ","replyto":null,"invitation":"ICLR.cc/2019/Conference/-/Blind_Submission","content":{"title":"Knowledge Distillation from Few Samples","abstract":"Current knowledge distillation methods require full training data to distill knowledge from a large \"teacher\" network to a compact \"student\" network by matching certain statistics between \"teacher\" and \"student\" such as softmax outputs and feature responses.

Since a change in the parameters might serve as a poor proxy for the change in the function, it is of some concern that primacy is given to parameters but that the correspondence has not been tested. Here, we show that it is simple and computationally feasible to calculate distances between functions in a $L^2$ Hilbert space. We examine how typical networks behave in this space, and compare how parameter $\\ell^2$ distances compare to function $L^2$ distances between various points of an optimization trajectory. We find that the two distances are nontrivially related. In particular, the $L^2/\\ell^2$ ratio decreases throughout optimization, reaching a steady value around when test error plateaus. We then investigate how the $L^2$ distance could be applied directly to optimization. We first propose that in multitask learning, one can avoid catastrophic forgetting by directly limiting how much the input/output function changes between tasks. Secondly, we propose a new learning rule that regularizes the distance a network can travel through $L^2$-space in any one update. This allows new examples to be learned in a way that minimally interferes with what has previously been learned.

In contrast to model-free methods, model-based planning lets the agent efficiently test action hypotheses without performing costly trial-and-error in the environment. L2P learns to efficiently form plans by expanding a single action-conditional state transition at a time instead of exhaustively evaluating each action, reducing the required number of state-transitions during planning by up to 96%. We observe various emergent planning patterns used to solve environments, including classical search methods such as breadth-first and depth-first search.

The result is a quantized representation of the RNN that can be analyzed to improve our understanding of memory use and general behavior. We present results of this approach on synthetic environments and six Atari games. The resulting finite representations are surprisingly small in some cases, using as few as 3 discrete memory states and 10 observations for a perfect Pong policy. We also show that these finite policy representations lead to improved interpretability.

In an ideal cross-lingual embedding, word similarity should be independent of language---i.e., words within a language should not be more similar to each other than to words in another language. One test of this is modularity, a network measurement that measures the strength of clusters in a graph. When we apply this measure to a nearest neighbor graph, imperfect cross-lingual embeddings are sorted into modular, distinct regions.

We prove that a discriminative representation can be learned by training a generative model using a loss function comprised of the difference of energies corresponding to each class. The learned energy value for each training instance is compared to the original training labels and contradictions between energy assignment and training label are used to correct labels. We validate our method across eight datasets, spanning synthetic and realistic settings, and demonstrate the technique's state-of-the-art label correction performance.
